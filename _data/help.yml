    - question: How do I create an account with login.gov?
      anchor: "how-do-i-create-an-account-with-logingov"
      content: |
        To create a login.gov account, you will need: a valid email address, and
        a working phone number. We will also ask you to create a password.

        #### Enter your email and confirm it

        Select “create an account” and enter your email address where indicated.
        Then check your email account for a message from us. Within the email is
        a link. Clicking the link will send you back to login.gov with your
        email confirmed.

        #### Enter your password

        Next, you will create a strong password. Use the password strength meter
        on the screen as a guide. Passwords must be at least 8 characters, but
        otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even enter spaces in
        between words to get to 8 characters.

        #### Enter your phone number and confirm it

        Next, you will enter a phone number at which you can get calls or SMS
        messages. If you have a landline, please ask for a security code by a
        phone call. We will send a unique security code to that phone number
        each time you sign into your account. This is called two-factor
        authentication. The second step keeps your account more secure than
        using only a password.

        Each security code expires after 5 minutes and can only be used once. If
        you don't enter the security code within 5 minutes, just request a new
        code. Each code is only good once, so no one can steal one you've
        already used.

        Type the security code into the field. That's it! You have just taken an
        important step to keep yourself and your government safe. Every time you
        sign back into your login.gov account, you will receive a new security
        code that you need to enter. You'll get the option each time you sign in
        to get a security code by a phone call or by SMS.

        #### Save your personal key

        After you've created your account, you will get a personal key, which is
        a set of 16 random characters. Make a note of them and store
        the note separately from your phone. If you forget your password or
        don't have your phone, you can enter the personal key to access your
        services or applications.
    - question: What is two-factor authentication?
      anchor: "what-is-two-factor-authentication"
      content: |
        login.gov uses two-factor authentication to keep accounts secure. As its
        name implies, two-factor authentication (sometimes called 2FA), requires two different methods to sign into an
        account. Usually this means entering a memorized password and a unique
        code sent to a device (such as a phone) that you own. Requiring two
        methods makes breaking into your account much harder.
    - question: Why do I need to confirm my email address and my phone number?
      anchor: "why-do-i-need-to-confirm-my-email-address-and-my-phone-number"
      content: |
        login.gov uses your email address and phone number to send important
        security messages about account activity. We won't use them for any
        other purposes, and we won't share them with anyone without your express
        permission.
    - question: I didn't receive a confirmation email from login.gov.
      anchor: "i-didnt-receive-a-confirmation-email-from-logingov"
      content: |
        If you didn't receive a confirmation email, check your spam filter.
        Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If
        so, you can always make another account with your correct email address.

        - If you mistyped your address, you can create a new
          account.
        - If you are certain you entered the correct address, choose “Send
          again” to get a new confirmation email.
    - question: Why didn't I receive a security code to confirm my phone?
      anchor: "why-didnt-i-receive-a-security-code-to-confirm-my-phone"
      content: |
        If you didn't receive a security code, check whether you entered your
        phone number correctly.

        - Did you enter a wrong phone number? Look for the option to enter it again.
        - If it's the right number, request the code again. Receive it by SMS or by
          a phone call on a landline or a mobile phone.
    - question: Do I need a mobile phone to use login.gov?
      anchor: "do-i-need-a-mobile-phone-to-use-logingov"
      content: |
        You do not need to own a mobile phone to use login.gov. You do need to
        provide a phone number – either a landline or a mobile phone – at which
        you can receive security codes every time you sign in either by SMS or
        phone call.
    - question: Why do I need to use login.gov to access government services online?
      anchor: "why-do-i-need-to-use-logingov-to-access-government-services-online"
      content: |
        Government agencies decide for themselves how they want to interact with
        the public. You were sent to login.gov because the service or program
        you want to use has chosen to take advantage of the efficiency and
        security of login.gov as a shared technology platform. Once you have
        finished at login.gov, you will be directed back to the agency.

        We hope login.gov is a convenient and secure option for you. However, if
        you prefer not to use login.gov, you can always access government
        services. You'll find more information at your agency.
    - question: What do I do if an account already exists under my email address?
      anchor: "what-do-i-do-if-an-account-already-exists-under-my-email-address"
      content: |
        Confirming access to an email address is the first step in making a
        login.gov account. If you received a notice that there is already a
        login.gov account associated with your email address but you don't
        remember creating it, use your email address to sign in and go through
        the password reset process.

        Please notify login.gov if you are sure you did not create an account,
        and feel like someone else is using your email address.

    - question: What do I need to have in order to sign in?
      anchor: "what-do-i-need-to-have-in-order-to-sign-in"
      content: |
        Every time you log into your account, you will need your email address,
        your password, and access to your phone. After you have entered your
        email address and password, login.gov will send to your phone a security
        code, which you will need to enter into the security code field in order
        to be logged in securely.
    - question: What do I do if my password doesn't work or I forget it?
      anchor: "what-do-i-do-if-my-password-doesnt-work-or-i-forget-it"
      content: |
        If you don't know your password, the link to reset it is on the sign-in
        page. Enter your email address to receive a link to reset your password.
        Once you follow the link, you'll be asked to enter a new password.
        Reconfirm that you have your phone (the one you will use to receive
        one-time passcodes).

        After you've successfully signed into login.gov after resetting your
        password, login.gov will give you a personal key. The personal key is to
        be used in the event you forget your password or don't have your phone
        with you. Make a note of it and store it separately from your phone.
    - question: What happens if I miss the phone call or the text message with my one-time security code?
      anchor: "what-happens-if-i-miss-the-phone-call-or-the-text-message-with-my-one-time-security-code"
      content: |
        Every time you sign in you will need to enter a security code that is
        sent to your phone either by text message or by phone call. The security
        code you receive expires after 5 minutes and can only be used once. If
        you miss entering the security code within the 5 minutes or you just
        missed the phone call, just request a new security code. Each security
        code is only good once, so no one can steal one you've already used. We
        limit requests to three every 15 minutes, but otherwise you can request
        as many codes as you need.
    - question: If I don't have my phone with me, can I still sign in?
      anchor: "if-i-dont-have-my-phone-with-me-can-i-still-sign-in"
      content: |
        It is necessary to have your phone in order to get the security key to
        sign in. But if you don't have your phone with you, you will need the
        personal key you received when you created your account. Enter the
        personal key when instructed and select submit. Once you are signed in,
        you will immediately get a new personal key. Please store the personal
        key in a safe place separately from your phone since the personal key
        will let you sign in to your account in case you don't have your phone
        with you.

        We encourage you to store your personal key somewhere other than your
        computer or mobile device — this way, you'll be able to access your
        personal key even if your device is stolen or your online accounts are
        hacked.
    - question: I can't remember where my personal key is and I don't have my phone with me.
      anchor: "i-cant-remember-where-my-personal-key-is-and-i-dont-have-my-phone-with-me"
      content: |
        If you don't have your phone or your personal key, you may need to
        create a new account and re-verify your personal information. To create
        a new account, you will need to use a different email address than you
        did when you created your first account. For urgent matters — for
        example, to check the status of an in-progress application — you may
        want to directly contact the government agency.

        Another option is to log in at a later time when you have your phone
        near you.
    - question: Why does the system log me out?
      anchor: "why-does-the-system-log-me-out"
      content: |
        When a user is already signed in, and they want to change their email,
        password, or phone number, they must enter their current password first.
        After three incorrect guesses, the user is signed out.

        The system also logs you out if you entered the security code that was
        sent to your phone, incorrectly 3 times. Failed attempts are limited to
        three per session, followed by a 5-minute lockout.
    - question: I forgot which email address I used to create an account.
      anchor: "i-forgot-which-email-address-i-used-to-create-an-account"
      content: |
        If you can't remember which email address you used to create your
        account, you can use the password reset function to see if your email
        address is on file.

        Try to sign in as usual and ask to have your password reset. Then, enter
        the email address you believe you used to create your account. If we
        have your email address in our records, we will send instructions on how
        to reset your password. Check your email in a few minutes for these
        instructions.

      anchor: "how-do-i-change-my-password"
      content: |
        To change your password, sign in at login.gov and go
        to your Profile page. If you want to change your password, select Edit next to
        password, enter the new password and submit your change. Passwords must be at
        least 8 characters but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even use
        more than one word with spaces to get to 8 characters.

        Instead, try making a long and complex password by using a phrase or a
        series of words that only you recognize. And please make it different
        than any other passwords you use to sign into other accounts such as
        your bank account or email. Using the same passwords for your email,
        financial and social media accounts makes identity theft easier.

      content: |
        login.gov respects your privacy. We collect personal data online only to
        help you fulfill your requests with federal agencies that partner with
        us. login.gov manages specific parts of that agency's website so we
        collect personal data in order to provide a secure and private
        environment for you to access certain government services. We are bound
        by our privacy policy. login.gov does not lease, sell or release your
        personal information to private companies, contractors, or vendors for
        marketing purposes.

        login.gov links to external federal government sites for services
        provided by those agencies. Those sites are subject to their own privacy
        policy, which is usually spelled out in a privacy policy and legal
        disclaimer available on their website.

        Individual accounts get a double layer of security. We require
        two-factor authentication as well as strong passwords that meet new
        [National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"}
        requirements for secure validation and verification. This includes
        two-factor authentication that requires you log in with your password and
        a security code you receive on your phone. Two-factor authentication can
        help protect your account against password compromises.

        Your information will stay secure. For more information, read our
        [security and privacy policy](site.baseurl/policy).
    - question: Will login.gov share my information?

      content: |
        login.gov cannot share any information with other government agencies
        without the user's permission. Not even login.gov administrators can
        decrypt or access a user's personal information without the user's
        password.
    - question: How do I make my password strong?
      anchor: "how-do-i-make-my-password-strong"
      content: |
        Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple
        words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with
        many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.

        When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and common
        misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your company
        name or your spouse's or children's names - and even your pet - as well
        as other personal information such as your age or birth date.

        If you're already signed in, and you're trying to change your password,
        email, or phone, you will be prompted to enter your current password
        before you can make the changes.

        But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely
        due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left
        unattended. In that case, for your security, we sign you out after three
        failed attempts.

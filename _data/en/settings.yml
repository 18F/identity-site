    create-your-account: |-
      Follow these steps to create your login.gov account.

      1. Enter your email address at [https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email](https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email) to begin.

          Choose an email address that you’ll always be able to access. Once your account is created, you can add an additional email address, such as a work email or alternate personal address, to access your account.
      1. Click the __“Submit”__ button.
      1. Check your email for a message from login.gov.
      1. Click the __“Confirm your email address”__ button in the message. This will take you back to the login.gov website.
      1. Create your login.gov password.

          Passwords must be at least 12 characters. That's it! There are no other restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 12 characters. Try using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize.

          Your login.gov password should be different from passwords you use for other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same password for many accounts makes identity theft easier.
      1. Set up a second layer of security.

          As an added layer of protection, login.gov requires you set up a secondary authentication method to keep your account secure. This is referred to as two-factor authentication (2FA).

          While we only require one secondary authentication method, we encourage you to add two methods to your account. That way you will have a backup if you lose access to your primary authentication method.

          You can choose from several authentication options.

          __More secure:__
          * Authentication application
          * Security key
          * PIV or CAC card for federal government employees or military

          __Less secure:__
          * Text message
          * Phone call
          * Backup codes

          [Learn more about each authentication option](site.baseurl/help/get-started/authentication-options) to choose the one that is right for you.

      1. Success! Once you have authenticated, you have created your login.gov account.
      {: .number-list}

      You will be taken to your login.gov account page or the government agency you are trying to access. You can add additional authentication methods, email addresses or update your information on the login.gov account page.

    authentication-options: |-
      In addition to your password, login.gov requires that you set up at least one secondary authentication method to keep your account secure. This is two-factor authentication (2FA). We use 2FA as an added layer of protection to secure your information.

      __Secondary authentication__
      We encourage you to add two methods for authentication to your account. If you lose access to your primary authentication method (i.e. losing your phone), you’ll have a second option to use to get access to your account. Login.gov is unable to grant you access to your account if you get locked out and/or lose your authentication method.

      __Security__
      Although you can choose from several authentication options, some authentication methods such as Security Keys, PIV/CAC cards and authentication applications are more secure against phishing and theft.

      ## Authentication application
      Authentication applications are downloaded to your device and generate secure, six-digit codes you use to sign in to your accounts. While authentication applications are not protected if your device is lost or stolen, this method offers more security than phone calls or text messaging against phishing, hacking, or interception.

      If you choose this secure option, follow these steps to download and install one of the supported applications and configure it to work with login.gov.

      1. Choose a device, such as a computer or mobile device (phone or tablet), on which you can install apps.
      1. Download and install an authentication app to your device. Some popular options include:
        * Android options: [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/).
        * iOS options: [Google Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [LastPass](https://1password.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/).
        * Windows apps: [1Password](https://1password.com/), [OTP Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/otp-manager/9nblggh6hngn).
        * Mac apps: [1Password](https://1password.com/), [OTP Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otp-manager/id928941247?mt=12).
        * Chrome extensions: [Authenticator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai?hl=en).
      1. Open a new browser and sign in to your login.gov account at [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/).
      1. Select “Enable” next to “Authentication app” and follow the instructions to scan or enter a code associating your authentication app with your account.
      {: .number-list}

      You will now be able to use the one-time passcodes generated by the application each time you sign in to login.gov.

      ## Security key
      A security key is typically an external physical device, like a USB, that you plug into your computer. The key is linked to your accounts and will only grant access to those accounts once the key is plugged in and activated. Since a security key does not rely on your cell phone, it has the highest level of protection against phishing and built-in protections against hacking if it is lost or stolen.

      Login.gov requires security keys that meet the [FIDO (Fast Identity Online) standards](https://fidoalliance.org/). You can add as many security keys as you want to secure your account.

      To use this secure option for login.gov authentication, plug the key into a USB port and assign the key a name to identify it with your login.gov account. The next step will ask you to activate your key. This is generally done by pressing a button on the key itself.

      ## PIV or CAC for federal government employees and military
      Physical PIV (personal identity verification) cards or CACs (common access cards) are secure options for federal government employees and military personnel. These cards, with encrypted chip technology, are resistant to phishing and difficult to hack if stolen.

      ## Text message / Phone call
      Text messages/SMS or phone calls are convenient but are extremely vulnerable to theft, hackers, and other attacks.

      If you choose to use this less secure option, enter a phone number at which you can receive phone calls or text messages. If you only have a landline, you must receive your security code by phone call. Login.gov cannot send security codes to extensions or voicemails.

      We will send a unique security code to that phone number each time you sign in to your login.gov account. Each security code expires after ten minutes and can only be used once. If you don’t enter the security code within ten minutes, request a new code.

      After you receive the code, type it into the “one-time security code” field. Each time you sign in to login.gov you’ll have the option of getting a new security code by phone call or by text. You will receive a new security code each time you sign in to your login.gov account.

      ## Backup codes (less secure)
      Backup codes are an accessible option for users who do not have access to a phone. However, backup codes are the least secure option for two-factor authentication. Backup codes must be printed or written down which makes them more vulnerable to theft and phishing.

      If you select this less secure option, login.gov will generate a set of ten codes. After you sign in with your username and password, you will be prompted for a code. Each code may be used only once. When the tenth code has been used you will be prompted to download a new list. Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password.

      ## No phone or other authentication method
      If you do not have access to a phone, authentication application, security key, or any other authentication option, you can set up your account with only backup codes.

      __Warning:__ Setting up your account with backup codes as your only authentication method is not recommended. If you ever lose your backup codes, you will not be able to sign in to your account.

      When you create your account, you will reach the “Secure your account” page. This is where you must choose your primary authentication method. If you do not have access to any of the other options, select “Backup codes” and click “Continue.”

      On the “Add another method” page, select “I don’t have any of the above” and click “Continue.”

  verify-your-identity:
    overview: |-
      Some participating agencies require you to complete an identity verification process. Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

      You only need to verify your identity once for your login.gov account. After you verify your identity with login.gov for one government application, you don’t need to do it again for other government applications that use login.gov and require identity verification.

      Use this help section to understand the process and requirements for identity verification.

      ## Common troubleshooting topics

      Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

      You will need to verify your identity and secure your account.

      ## Requirements for identity verification
      1. Your State-Issued ID. You can upload a photo by phone or by computer. Don’t have a state issued ID?
      1. A phone or computer with a camera to take a photo of yourself (not always required)
      1. Social Security Number
      1. A phone number on a phone plan that is in your name.
          * If you do not have a phone plan that is in your name, we can send you the verification code by mail which takes approximately 3-5 days.

      If you are missing any of this information, please contact the government agency you are trying to access.

      ## Our privacy and security standards
      Login.gov is a secure, government website that adheres to the highest standards in data protection. Most of the data you submit is not stored. Learn how we verify your identity and the [privacy and security measures](site.baseurl/policy) we take to keep your information safe.

      ## Steps for identity verification and securing your account
      1. On the “We need to verify your identity” page, read the requirements and, if you agree, check the box next to the login.gov consent statement.
          * Click “Continue”
      1. Next, upload your State-Issued ID.
          * Note: If you began the identity verification process on your computer, you have the option to switch and use your phone to upload images.

          **Continue by computer and upload images**

          * Upload an image of the FRONT of your state-issued ID by clicking on “Choose File.”
              * Select the file from your computer
          * Upload an image of the BACK of your state-issued ID by clicking on “Choose File.”
              * Select the file from your computer
              * Click continue

          **Switch from computer to phone to upload images**

          * Enter your phone number.
              * Choose a phone number where you can receive SMS/Text messages and click “Continue.”
          * Click on the link sent to your phone.
          * You will see options to either “take a photo” or “upload a photo.”
              * Upload an image of the FRONT of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the front of your ID
              * Upload an image of the BACK of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the back of your ID
          * Return to computer to complete the process

          **Continue by phone and upload images**

          * You will see a screen with ‘front’ and ‘back’ in large squares and an option to either “take a photo” or “upload a photo.”

    Solving real problems for potential users should be the focus for any system, and is doubly important when building an identity management system. Throughout this playbook, you’ll see how satisfying user needs is a guiding principle in every decision made.

    One of the first steps you should take is identifying your core users. For login.gov, we’ve identified two groups as our core users: the general public and tech people inside government agencies. The goal for the system itself is to support and address the needs of the general public. To put it plainly, we want to make sure that our system makes people comfortable with logging in to government services. The public needs to feel confident that login.gov behaves as expected and will not disappoint them. The system also needs to address users’ entire experience as they try to accomplish their goals. Because identity verification and authentication is technologically complex, it’s not unlikely that even the most tech-savvy people could get stuck if their phone is lost or a system has errors. So in support of each agency’s mission, architects and designers of consumer identity management systems need to anticipate likely sticking points so that people don’t lose access to the services and benefits.

    Agencies should figure out what portion of the public they serve and how services can be built to address their needs specifically. This will help agency integration teams understand what they need if they decide to implement the login.gov platform or any other consumer identity management system.

    Finally, you should continuously test designs and tools as they’re ready to share and then adjust your project based on what you learn. In some cases, we learn that the current best practices aren’t good enough. And in those cases we’re pushed to try out new ways to give the users the best experience possible. That process involves further testing, educating users, and a willingness to iterate.

    There are a number of specific design methods we practice to remain user-centered, and you can read about all of them, and use them yourself, by reviewing the [18F Design Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/).
  p_2: |-
    [Working transparently](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13) and creating a transparent system should be the way any agency works when building or implementing an identity management system. To execute this principle with login.gov, we’re building the platform so that interested parties can advise us on best practices and so that we remain accountable to the public and to our partners across the government. Further, it means building a system that tells users what it does with their information to create accountability and build trust. We’re engaging users and other interested parties through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp) and working on creating public forums where people can discuss our work.

    To make an identity management system transparent for end users, the system you build should include features that educate people about how the system works, why it works that way, and how they can control what’s happening with their data. You should also let users know what information is needed by an agency when logging in to a service. It’s also important to tell users what information your systems will store and if any data is shared with other agencies. If people using the system aren’t comfortable with information sharing, they shouldn’t be forced to participate.

    login.gov is working to implement all of these transparency-enhancing features. Further, to help people understand all that is happening, we’re creating a privacy policy that explains how data is shared and what it means to opt out.
  p_3: |-
    Technology and standards for identity verification and authentication can change rapidly. Consumer identity management systems should readily adapt to changing standards and react to new security threats. To make adapting to new policies and capabilities possible, it’s a good practice to build products using agile methods and with changing versions in mind. In other words, plan for modifications to help your identity service be as up-to-date as possible and compliant with current standards and policies.

    We’re embracing this principle for every aspect of the project in building login.gov.

    [Read this guide](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/index.html) to agile principles and practices put together by the 18F team to learn more about what it means to work in an agile way.
  p_4: |-
    Consumer identity management systems store personal information about users so that people don’t have to repeat the verification and authentication processes over and over again. However, collecting and storing personal information raises ethical and legal questions that system designers and developers need to consider. Often, what comes to mind first are technical questions about security: protecting information from unauthorized or illegal access and uses. However, we also need to worry about authorized, legal uses of personal information that violate users’ expectations of privacy. Users of login.gov need to be sure that we’re handling their personal information respectfully and appropriately.

    The first step is only collecting the information you absolutely need. And that’s what login.gov is doing. High-assurance identity verification for sensitive tasks does require extensive information collection. However, many activities don’t require high levels of assurance (LOA) and login.gov supports different LOA so agencies can clearly delineate their users who need lower levels of security from those with more sensitive needs while ensuring usability and data security. Minimizing the amount of information collected and stored not only lowers the security risk; it also reduces worries about re-use and disclosure for users.

    The next step is to give users as much control as possible over what information is shared. We believe firmly that people own their data, not us, and we will always act accordingly. If people aren’t comfortable with the data requirements for using a system, they should know they don’t have to sign up, and that there are other ways to accomplish their goals.

    As we design login.gov, we’re also working to educate users to help them safeguard their own data. We want people to understand why we have to ask for certain kinds of sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and how we’re using them.
  p_5: |-
    Figuring out who is trying to access personal information and making sure only authorized users can gain access to that information are the keys to consumer identity management. The reason systems like this exist is to secure the user’s identity from those looking to commit theft or fraud.

    Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.

    In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.

    In building login.gov, we’re adhering to standards put forward by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) (NIST 800-63-3). Additionally we’re adhering to [government security best practices](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11) including FedRAMP, building in the open, conducting rigorous and routine security evaluations in addition to compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

      standards for secure authentication and verification. Our plans for ongoing
      security include regular penetration testing and external security reviews.

      Individual accounts get a double layer of security. We require
      two-factor authentication as well as strong passwords that meet
      new NIST requirements. two-factor authentication requires that
      you login with your password and a code that we send to your phone.
    p_2: |-
      We will evaluate and implement new authentication methods as they
      become widely available to make sure that login.gov remains
      accessible and secure.

      Encrypting personal data separately means that login.gov cannot
      share any sensitive information with other government entities without
      users’ permission. Not even database administrators can decrypt
      a user’s personal information without the user’s password.

      login.gov encrypts the sensitive personal information of each user
      separately using a unique value generated from each user’s password.
      Our encryption method works like a safe deposit box in a bank vault.
      Only the user has the key. Only the user can open the box to reveal
      the contents. Only the user knows the password, and only the user can
      decrypt their information.

      privacy is being protected by design.

    With one login.gov account, users can securely sign in to multiple government agencies online. login.gov is a FedRAMP approved authentication and identity proofing platform that makes online interactions with the U.S. government simple, efficient and intuitive. login.gov empowers people to feel safe signing into government websites and accessing federal services online with a single, privacy-protected account. We enable agencies managing federal benefits, services, and applications to make their offerings easier and more secure. We save agencies time and money by offering a shared solution for remote identity proofing that is secure and recommended by the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-288).

    login.gov offers the public a single, secure, and private access to online federal services, eliminating the need to remember passwords for multiple systems.  It also reduces costs of developing or buying duplicative authentication and proofing solutions for agencies, so they can focus on their mission. The more agencies that adopt login.gov, the more taxpayers save. Through login.gov agencies can provide a more consistent customer experience by reducing duplicate accounts and encouraging a 21st Century IDEA compliant experience.
  p_3: |-
    login.gov offers secure two-factor authentication with widely available as well as unphishable methods. This service provides users with secure access to digital services at over 17 different government agencies with a single set of credentials. For you, this means leveraging the best security defined by NIST 800-63 Identity Assurance Level 1 and Authentication Assurance Level 2, and FedRAMP Moderate while complying with 21st Century Idea Act in a easy-to-use experience.

    login.gov identity verification builds on the security of our authentication service and provides a remote proofing experience using an individual’s state-issued ID rather than knowledge-based verification. Our remote proofing implementation complies with NIST’s IAL2. The login.gov verified accounts (IAL2/AAL2) allows applications to access verified attributes about a user such as a phone number and a social security number while maintaining user privacy by requiring the user’s consent and password to decrypt the data.

    Nobody likes managing dozens of accounts, along with remembering passwords, resetting passwords, reactivating their inactive accounts, and more. It’s frustrating and cumbersome, and insecure. Our vision is to create a single trusted account for the public to access all U.S. government digital services. For agencies, login.gov eliminates the burden and cost of creating and maintaining authentication and identity proofing systems, keeping up with evolving standards and technologies, and lowering costs.

  intro: When you’re ready to create your secure login.gov account, you’ll need to provide a few pieces of information&#58;
  step_1: |-
    ## 1. Email address
      * We recommend a personal email address that you’ll always be able to access rather than a work email address.
      * If you already have an account with login.gov with that email address, we’ll send you an email to let you know how you can reset your password and access the account.
  step_2: |-
    ## 2. Secure password
      * Passwords must be at least 12 characters and should not include commonly used words or phrases.
  step_3: |-
    ## 3. One or more [authentication methods](site.baseurl/help/authentication-methods/which-authentication-method-should-i-use/) such as:
      * __More secure__
        * Security Key
        * Authentication application
        * Federal government employee or military identification (PIV/CAC)
      * __Less secure__
        * SMS/Text messages
        * Backup codes
  info: Depending on the security needs of the agency, you may need to prove your identity using a social security number, address, and/or U.S. based state-issued identification.

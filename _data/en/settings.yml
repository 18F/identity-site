    create-your-account: |-
      Follow these steps to create your login.gov account.

      1. Enter your email address at [https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email](https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email) to begin.

          Choose an email address that you’ll always be able to access. Once your account is created, you can add an additional email address, such as a work email or alternate personal address, to access your account.
      1. Click the __“Submit”__ button.
      1. Check your email for a message from login.gov.
      1. Click the __“Confirm your email address”__ button in the message. This will take you back to the login.gov website.
      1. Create your login.gov password.

          Passwords must be at least 12 characters. That's it! There are no other restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 12 characters. Try using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize.

          Your login.gov password should be different from passwords you use for other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same password for many accounts makes identity theft easier.
      1. Set up a second layer of security.

          As an added layer of protection, login.gov requires you set up a secondary authentication method to keep your account secure. This is referred to as two-factor authentication (2FA).

          While we only require one secondary authentication method, we encourage you to add two methods to your account. That way you will have a backup if you lose access to your primary authentication method.

          You can choose from several authentication options.

          __More secure:__
          * Authentication application
          * Security key
          * PIV or CAC card for federal government employees or military

          __Less secure:__
          * Text message
          * Phone call
          * Backup codes

          [Learn more about each authentication option](site.baseurl/help/get-started/authentication-options) to choose the one that is right for you.

      1. Success! Once you have authenticated, you have created your login.gov account.
      {: .number-list}

      You will be taken to your login.gov account page or the government agency you are trying to access. You can add additional authentication methods, email addresses or update your information on the login.gov account page.

    authentication-options: |-
      In addition to your password, login.gov requires that you set up at least one secondary authentication method to keep your account secure. This is two-factor authentication (2FA). We use 2FA as an added layer of protection to secure your information.

      __Secondary authentication__
      We encourage you to add two methods for authentication to your account. If you lose access to your primary authentication method (i.e. losing your phone), you’ll have a second option to use to get access to your account. Login.gov is unable to grant you access to your account if you get locked out and/or lose your authentication method.

      __Security__
      Although you can choose from several authentication options, some authentication methods such as Security Keys, PIV/CAC cards and authentication applications are more secure against phishing and theft.

      ## Authentication application
      Authentication applications are downloaded to your device and generate secure, six-digit codes you use to sign in to your accounts. While authentication applications are not protected if your device is lost or stolen, this method offers more security than phone calls or text messaging against phishing, hacking, or interception.

      If you choose this secure option, follow these steps to download and install one of the supported applications and configure it to work with login.gov.

      1. Choose a device, such as a computer or mobile device (phone or tablet), on which you can install apps.
      1. Download and install an authentication app to your device. Some popular options include:
        * Android options: [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/).
        * iOS options: [Google Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [LastPass](https://1password.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/).
        * Windows apps: [1Password](https://1password.com/), [OTP Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/otp-manager/9nblggh6hngn).
        * Mac apps: [1Password](https://1password.com/), [OTP Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otp-manager/id928941247?mt=12).
        * Chrome extensions: [Authenticator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai?hl=en).
      1. Open a new browser and sign in to your login.gov account at [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/).
      1. Select “Enable” next to “Authentication app” and follow the instructions to scan or enter a code associating your authentication app with your account.
      {: .number-list}

      You will now be able to use the one-time passcodes generated by the application each time you sign in to login.gov.

      ## Security key
      A security key is typically an external physical device, like a USB, that you plug into your computer. The key is linked to your accounts and will only grant access to those accounts once the key is plugged in and activated. Since a security key does not rely on your cell phone, it has the highest level of protection against phishing and built-in protections against hacking if it is lost or stolen.

      Login.gov requires security keys that meet the [FIDO (Fast Identity Online) standards](https://fidoalliance.org/). You can add as many security keys as you want to secure your account.

      To use this secure option for login.gov authentication, plug the key into a USB port and assign the key a name to identify it with your login.gov account. The next step will ask you to activate your key. This is generally done by pressing a button on the key itself.

      ## PIV or CAC for federal government employees and military
      Physical PIV (personal identity verification) cards or CACs (common access cards) are secure options for federal government employees and military personnel. These cards, with encrypted chip technology, are resistant to phishing and difficult to hack if stolen.

      ## Text message / Phone call
      Text messages/SMS or phone calls are convenient but are extremely vulnerable to theft, hackers, and other attacks.

      If you choose to use this less secure option, enter a phone number at which you can receive phone calls or text messages. If you only have a landline, you must receive your security code by phone call. Login.gov cannot send security codes to extensions or voicemails.

      We will send a unique security code to that phone number each time you sign in to your login.gov account. Each security code expires after ten minutes and can only be used once. If you don’t enter the security code within ten minutes, request a new code.

      After you receive the code, type it into the “one-time security code” field. Each time you sign in to login.gov you’ll have the option of getting a new security code by phone call or by text. You will receive a new security code each time you sign in to your login.gov account.

      ## Backup codes (less secure)
      Backup codes are an accessible option for users who do not have access to a phone. However, backup codes are the least secure option for two-factor authentication. Backup codes must be printed or written down which makes them more vulnerable to theft and phishing.

      If you select this less secure option, login.gov will generate a set of ten codes. After you sign in with your username and password, you will be prompted for a code. Each code may be used only once. When the tenth code has been used you will be prompted to download a new list. Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password.

      ## No phone or other authentication method
      If you do not have access to a phone, authentication application, security key, or any other authentication option, you can set up your account with only backup codes.

      __Warning:__ Setting up your account with backup codes as your only authentication method is not recommended. If you ever lose your backup codes, you will not be able to sign in to your account.

      When you create your account, you will reach the “Secure your account” page. This is where you must choose your primary authentication method. If you do not have access to any of the other options, select “Backup codes” and click “Continue.”

      On the “Add another method” page, select “I don’t have any of the above” and click “Continue.”

  verify-your-identity:
    overview: |-
      Some participating agencies require you to complete an identity verification process. Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

      You only need to verify your identity once for your login.gov account. After you verify your identity with login.gov for one government application, you don’t need to do it again for other government applications that use login.gov and require identity verification.

      Use this help section to understand the process and requirements for identity verification.

      ## Common troubleshooting topics

    how-to-verify-your-identity: |-
      Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

      You will need to verify your identity and secure your account.

      ## Requirements for identity verification
      1. Your State-Issued ID. You can upload a photo by phone or by computer. Don’t have a state issued ID?
      1. A phone or computer with a camera to take a photo of yourself (not always required)
      1. Social Security Number
      1. A phone number on a phone plan that is in your name.
          * If you do not have a phone plan that is in your name, we can send you the verification code by mail which takes approximately 3-5 days.

      If you are missing any of this information, please contact the government agency you are trying to access.

      ## Our privacy and security standards
      Login.gov is a secure, government website that adheres to the highest standards in data protection. Most of the data you submit is not stored. Learn how we verify your identity and the [privacy and security measures](site.baseurl/policy) we take to keep your information safe.

      ## Steps for identity verification and securing your account
      1. On the “We need to verify your identity” page, read the requirements and, if you agree, check the box next to the login.gov consent statement.
          * Click “Continue”
      1. Next, upload your State-Issued ID.
          * Note: If you began the identity verification process on your computer, you have the option to switch and use your phone to upload images.

          **Continue by computer and upload images**

          * Upload an image of the FRONT of your state-issued ID by clicking on “Choose File.”
              * Select the file from your computer
          * Upload an image of the BACK of your state-issued ID by clicking on “Choose File.”
              * Select the file from your computer
              * Click continue

          **Switch from computer to phone to upload images**

          * Enter your phone number.
              * Choose a phone number where you can receive SMS/Text messages and click “Continue.”
          * Click on the link sent to your phone.
          * You will see options to either “take a photo” or “upload a photo.”
              * Upload an image of the FRONT of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the front of your ID
              * Upload an image of the BACK of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the back of your ID
          * Return to computer to complete the process

          **Continue by phone and upload images**

          * You will see a screen with ‘front’ and ‘back’ in large squares and an option to either “take a photo” or “upload a photo.”
              * Upload an image of the FRONT of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the front of your ID
              * Upload an image of the BACK of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the back of your ID
          * Click “Continue”
      1.  For some applications, you may be asked to take a photo of yourself. If the “Take a Photo of Yourself” screen appears, follow the guidelines to take a photo of yourself using either your computer, switching from your computer to phone, or only using your phone.
          * Once you have an acceptable photo, Click “Submit”
          * Your images will process and if accepted, an acceptance message will appear and you can continue the process.
          * If rejected, please review the error message and resubmit your photo.
      1.  Enter your social security number and click “Continue”
      1.  Verify the information you have submitted so far is correct and click “Continue”
      1.  Enter a phone number with your name on the plan. This is the last step for identity verification.
          * If you do not have a phone plan with your name on it or a U.S. phone number, click on “Get a code via mail instead.” You will have to wait to receive a letter in the mail and then follow the instructions to enter the code.
      1.  Once your identity is verified, you need to encrypt your account. Re-enter your login.gov password. Click “Continue”
      1.  Take note of your personal key and keep it safe. You’ll need to enter your personal key immediately on the next page. Click “Continue”

    With one login.gov account, users can securely sign in to multiple government agencies online. login.gov is a FedRAMP approved authentication and identity proofing platform that makes online interactions with the U.S. government simple, efficient and intuitive. login.gov empowers people to feel safe signing into government websites and accessing federal services online with a single, privacy-protected account. We enable agencies managing federal benefits, services, and applications to make their offerings easier and more secure. We save agencies time and money by offering a shared solution for remote identity proofing that is secure and recommended by the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-288).
  p_2: |-
    login.gov offers the public a single, secure, and private access to online federal services, eliminating the need to remember passwords for multiple systems.  It also reduces costs of developing or buying duplicative authentication and proofing solutions for agencies, so they can focus on their mission. The more agencies that adopt login.gov, the more taxpayers save. Through login.gov agencies can provide a more consistent customer experience by reducing duplicate accounts and encouraging a 21st Century IDEA compliant experience.
  p_3: |-
    login.gov offers secure two-factor authentication with widely available as well as unphishable methods. This service provides users with secure access to digital services at over 17 different government agencies with a single set of credentials. For you, this means leveraging the best security defined by NIST 800-63 Identity Assurance Level 1 and Authentication Assurance Level 2, and FedRAMP Moderate while complying with 21st Century Idea Act in a easy-to-use experience.

    login.gov identity verification builds on the security of our authentication service and provides a remote proofing experience using an individual’s state-issued ID rather than knowledge-based verification. Our remote proofing implementation complies with NIST’s IAL2. The login.gov verified accounts (IAL2/AAL2) allows applications to access verified attributes about a user such as a phone number and a social security number while maintaining user privacy by requiring the user’s consent and password to decrypt the data.
  p_4: |-
    Nobody likes managing dozens of accounts, along with remembering passwords, resetting passwords, reactivating their inactive accounts, and more. It’s frustrating and cumbersome, and insecure. Our vision is to create a single trusted account for the public to access all U.S. government digital services. For agencies, login.gov eliminates the burden and cost of creating and maintaining authentication and identity proofing systems, keeping up with evolving standards and technologies, and lowering costs.
  p_5: |-
    We want to offer secure and modern authentication to the entire US public. Federal agencies and the public benefit from login.gov because

    We are also keeping ahead of evolving security threats by leading industry in adopting emerging authentication security methods such as WebAuthn and building a product to encourage more secure methods.
  p_7: |-
    We provide an online remote identity proofing platform that allows agencies to verify that their users are who they say they are from the convenience of their own home. We have worked with some of the most recognizable brands in the Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) space to bring one solution to the federal government. login.gov meets NIST’s Identity Assurance Level 2 making it a great fit for applications that need to feel confident about their users.

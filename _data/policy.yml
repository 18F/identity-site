    login.gov uses a variety of security methods to protect this U.S.
    government service and your data, and to ensure the service remains
    available to all users. These methods include monitoring and recording
    network traffic (any data going in and out of login.gov) to identify
    unauthorized attempts to change information, or otherwise cause damage.

    Unauthorized access or use of login.gov (e.g. use for criminal purposes,
    or to cause damage, etc) is against the law, and may subject you to
    criminal prosecution and penalties.

    ### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

    login.gov authorizes the outside security community to perform security
    research for the intent of reporting discovered security vulnerabilities
    in the login.gov platform.

    This privacy notice describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect
    your personal information, as well as your obligation to disclose it.

    Our goal is to protect your personal information, and we will not share
    it without your permission. For example, we will encrypt your personal
    information in transit and at rest and ask you before sharing your data
    with a partner agency. However, there may be circumstances where we are
    required to share certain data. For example: if the information is relevant
    and necessary for an authorized law enforcement purpose; in order to
    respond to a breach; or to assist another agency as it responds to a
    breach. For additional information, see the [system of record notice number GSA/TTS-1](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01174/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-new-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}

    ### Privacy Act statement

    #### Authorities

    The information you provide to access your login.gov account is
    collected pursuant to 6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E), the [E-Government Act of 2002 (44 USC § 3501)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ347/html/PLAW-107publ347.htm){:target="_blank"},
    and 40 USC § 501.  

    #### Purpose

    The information that you submit is used to create or update your
    login.gov account. Once you create an account, with
    your consent, login.gov will share your email address with the partner agency to
    provide online access to government information and services.

    #### Disclosure

    You decide what information to give us. However, failure to provide
    complete and accurate information may delay access to the partner agency.
    The information you give login.gov will be shared with the applicable
    federal agency to provide access to information about you held by that
    agency as described in the associated [systems of records notices](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01174/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-new-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}.
    Please note that the login.gov system will record certain session-level information
    about your use of the service, including but not limited to, web browser
    type and version, and the length of your session. This information allows
    login.gov better understand how the site is being used and how it can be
    made more helpful.

    #### Storage

    All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s
    [Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"}.
    You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number
    by accessing it in your account. You should choose an email address
    through which you would like to receive correspondence from any partner
    agency whose services or information you might access. Changing that
    address will redirect all email correspondence with any partner agency.
     
    Similarly, you should choose the number of a phone that you have access
    to in order to receive and respond with the one-time password(s) that
    are sent to that number.

    Your email address and phone number will be maintained for at least six
    years in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration
    (NARA) guidance. However, GSA is authorized to maintain the information
    for longer if it is required for business use. login.gov must be able
    to provide users access to information and services at partner agencies
    and therefore may have a business need to retain the information longer
    than the six-year retention period.

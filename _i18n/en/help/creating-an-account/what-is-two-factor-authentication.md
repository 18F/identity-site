login.gov uses two-factor authentication to keep accounts secure. As its name implies, two-factor authentication (sometimes called 2FA), requires two different methods to sign into an account. Usually this means entering a memorized password and a unique code sent to a device (such as a phone) that you own. Requiring two methods makes breaking into your account much harder.

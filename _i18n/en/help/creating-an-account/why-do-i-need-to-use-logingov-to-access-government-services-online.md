Government agencies decide for themselves how they want to interact with the public. You were sent to login.gov because the service or program you want to use has chosen to take advantage of the efficiency and security of login.gov as a shared technology platform. Once you have finished at login.gov, you will be directed back to the agency.

We hope login.gov is a convenient and secure option for you. However, if you prefer not to use login.gov, you can always access government services. You'll find more information at your agency.

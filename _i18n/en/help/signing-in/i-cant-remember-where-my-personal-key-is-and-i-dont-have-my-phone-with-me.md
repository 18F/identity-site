If you don't have your phone or your personal key, you may need to create a new account and re-verify your personal information. To create a new account, you will need to use a different email address than you did when you created your first account. For urgent matters — for example, to check the status of an in-progress application — you may want to directly contact the government agency.

Another option is to log in at a later time when you have your phone near you.

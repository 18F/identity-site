When a user is already signed in, and they want to change their email, password, or phone number, they must enter their current password first. After three incorrect guesses, the user is signed out.

The system also logs you out if you entered the security code that was sent to your phone, incorrectly 3 times. Failed attempts are limited to three per session, followed by a 5-minute lockout.

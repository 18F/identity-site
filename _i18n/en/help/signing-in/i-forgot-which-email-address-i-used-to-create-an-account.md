If you can't remember which email address you used to create your account, you can use the password reset function to see if your email address is on file.

Try to sign in as usual and ask to have your password reset. Then, enter the email address you believe you used to create your account. If we have your email address in our records, we will send instructions on how to reset your password. Check your email in a few minutes for these instructions.

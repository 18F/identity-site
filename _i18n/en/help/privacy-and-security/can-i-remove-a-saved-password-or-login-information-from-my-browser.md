If you accidentally saved your login.gov password or other sign-in information in your browser, it's a good idea for you to delete it; this will help you keep your account more secure. From the following list, select the browser (the computer program you use to access the World Wide Web) you use to learn how to make it erase any saved information:

Also, remember whenever you're online, check the address bar of any webpage you're visiting to make sure that you can trust them, especially any page that asks you to share a username and password. Be careful about sharing personal information such as your login credentials, financial information, or Social Security number over email.

      You can add or delete email addresses from your login.gov Your Account page.

      <b>To add an email address</b> to your account, use the steps below:
        1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/){:target="_blank"} and sign in to your account
        2. Click on “Add email”
        3. Enter the email address you want to add to your account and click Submit
        4. You will receive an email in your inbox. Click on the link to confirm your email address.
      The link will take you to the Your account page. You will see a green alert message confirming that your email address was added.

      <b>To delete an email address</b> from your account, use the steps below:
      Note: you can’t delete an email address if it’s the only one linked to your account.
        1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/){:target="_blank"} and sign in to your account
        2. Click on the “Delete” link that is next to the email address you want to delete
        3. Make sure the next page shows the correct email address that you want to delete
        4. Click on “Delete email address”
      You will see a green alert message confirming that your email address was removed.
    email-address-is-already-in-use: |-
      If you try to add an email address that is connected to another login.gov account, you will get an error message that says, “You have confirmed your email address but it is associated with another login.gov account. You need to remove it from the other account before you can associate it with this one.”

      You can’t add the same email address to two different login.gov accounts, but you can combine the two accounts. To combine accounts, use the steps below:
        1. Delete one of the accounts
        2. Sign in to the other account and add the email address that was linked to the account you just deleted
        3. Relink the application profiles that were linked to your deleted account

    delete-my-account: |-
      Deleting your account is the first step to resetting it or combining multiple accounts. If you do not have access to your two-factor authentication method, it will take at least 24 hours to delete your account.

      After you delete your account, you will not be able to sign in to the government applications that you normally use this account for. You will not lose the information in those application profiles, but you will need to relink a new login.gov account to be able to sign in to them.

      To delete your account, use the steps below:
        1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/){:target="_blank"}
        2. Sign in with your email, password, and authentication method
        3. On the Your Account page, scroll to the bottom and click on “Delete”
        4. Confirm that you are sure you want to delete your account by clicking on “Delete account”

      If you don’t have access to your authentication methods, use the steps below:
        1. Go to your government application sign in page or to [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/){:target="_blank"}
        2. Sign in with your email and password
        3. On the authentication page (enter your security, app, or backup code; PIV/CAC card; or security key), click on “Choose another security option”
        4. Scroll to the bottom and click on the “deleting your account” link
        5. Read through all the information carefully to make sure deleting your account is your only option
        6. Click on “Yes, continue deletion”
        7. You will immediately receive an email confirming that we receive your request to delete your account. Your account is not deleted yet. As a security measure, you must wait 24 hours for a second email and click on the link.
        8. 24 hours later, you will receive a second email. You must open the email and confirm that you want to delete your account by clicking on the link. (Note: The link will expire after 24 hours. Afterwards, you will have to start the account deletion process again.)

      If you are deleting your account to combine it with another, you can now add this email address to your other account. Then, you can relink your application profiles.

      If you are resetting your account, you can now relink your application profiles.

    get-a-new-personal-key: |-
      We are currently in the process of retiring personal keys. It is highly suggested you configure one or more additional second factor authentication methods. To do so sign in to your account page and request backup codes, configure a phone, register a security key, configure an authentication app, or, if you are a government employee, attach your PIV/CAC card to your account.

      If you have a valid personal key you will still be able to use it in the case you have lost your other authentication mechanism. Once you use the personal key however you will no longer be generated a new one. Instead you will have to configure a different authentication mechanism. After entering your personal key you will be redirected to a screen that will prompt you to choose one or more additional authentication mechanisms.
    change-my-email-address: To change the email address associated with your login.gov
      account, go to [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/) and
      sign in to your login.gov account. Click on "Add email” and go through the process of adding your new email address.
      Then, click on "Delete" next to the email address you are replacing and go through the process of deleting it.

    change-my-password: |-
      To change your password, go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and select “Sign In” to sign into your login.gov account. Select “Edit” next to password, enter the new password and submit your change. Passwords must be at least 12 characters but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 12 characters. Try making a long and complex password by using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize. And please make it different than any other passwords you use to sign into other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same passwords for your email, financial and social media accounts makes identity theft easier.

    change-my-phone-number: |-
      To change the phone number where you get your security code, go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and select “Sign In” to access your login.gov account. Once signed in, click on “Manage” next to the phone number. Enter the phone number and select “confirm change.” login.gov will immediately send your security code to confirm the new phone number.

      If you cannot receive the security code because you don't have access to your phone, you will need to sign in using your [personal key](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/personal-key/), if you were assigned one and it's still valid, or using another [two-factor authentication method](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/two-factor-authentication/) you've set up.
    turn-off-two-factor-authentication: |-
      login.gov does not allow you to turn off two-factor authentication, but you can set up the "remember browser" feature. This will allow you to sign in without entering a security code for 30 days. Every 30 days you will be required to renew this feature by going through the normal two-factor authentication steps and selecting "remember browser." NOTE: If you use login.gov on multiple devices and browsers, you must set up “remember browser” on each one.

        1. Enter email and password to begin sign in process.
        2. Enter the security code and select “Remember this browser for 30 days”.
        3. After setting up "remember browser," you will not be prompted to enter a security code for 30 days.
    remove-saved-password-from-browser: |-
      If you accidentally saved your login.gov password or other sign-in information in your browser, it's a good idea for you to delete it; this will help you keep your account more secure. From the following list, select the browser (the computer program you use to access the World Wide Web) you use to learn how to make it erase any saved information:

      - [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606){:target="_blank"}

      Also, remember whenever you're online, check the address bar of any webpage you're visiting to make sure that you can trust them, especially any page that asks you to share a username and password. Be careful about sharing personal information such as your login credentials, financial information, or Social Security number over email.

      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/1-login-gov-welcome.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Login.gov create account page help image" />
      To create a login.gov account you’ll need a valid email address and a working phone number. We’ll also ask you to create a password.

      Please be prepared to configure another authentication method out of the list available. Using this secondary authentication method allows us to protect your account better.

      ### Enter your email and confirm it
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/2-login-gov-enteremail.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Enter your email help image" />
      Select [“create an account”](https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email) and enter your email address. Then check your email account for a message from us. Within the email is a link. Selecting the link will confirm your email address and send you back to login.gov.
      This is what it looks like:
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/3-confirm-your-email.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Confirm your email help image" />

      ### Create a password
      Next, you will create a strong password. Use the password strength meter on the screen as a guide. Passwords must be at least 12 characters, but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even enter spaces in between words to get to 12 characters.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/4-choose-a-password.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Choose password help image" />

      ### Configure a second layer of security
      Next, you will configure a secondary authentication method. The second step keeps your account more secure than using only a password. You can choose between text messages, phone calls, an authentication application, a security key, or backup codes. Government employees can also use their PIV or CAC cards.

      Login.gov uses two-factor authentication (TFA), or multi-factor authentication (MFA), as an added layer of protection to secure your most sensitive information.

      Two-factor authentication can be done in multiple ways and each has a different level of security. You can choose between text messages, phone calls, an authentication application, a security key, or backup codes. Government employees can also use their PIV or CAC cards.

      We encourage you to review the available options and select the most secure option for you.

      [Learn more about each authentication method.](site.baseurl/help/authentication-methods/which-authentication-method-should-i-use/)

      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/2nd_factor_options.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="2nd factor options help image" />

      #### Authentication application
      Authentication apps are downloaded to your device and generate secure, 6-digit codes you can use to log in to your accounts. Unlike phone calls or text messaging/SMS, a hacker would need physical access to your cell phone in order to use the code.

      While authentication apps are not protected if your device is lost or stolen, these apps offer more security than phone calls or text messaging/SMS against phishing, hacking or interception.

      If you choose to use this secure option, you can download and install one of the supported applications and configure it to work with login.gov. Learn how to set up an authentication app.

      #### Security key
      A security key is typically a physical device, like a USB, that you plug into your computer. The key is linked to your accounts and will only grant access to those accounts once the key is plugged in and activated. Since a security key does not rely on your cell phone, it has the highest level of protection against phishing and built in protections against hacking if it is lost or stolen.

      Login.gov requires security keys that meet the FIDO standards. You can also add as many security keys as you want to secure your account.

      To use this secure option for authentication, plug the key into a USB port and assign the key a name to identify it within your login.gov account. The next step will ask you to activate your key. This is generally done by pressing a button on the key itself.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/security_key.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Security key help image" />

      #### Text message/SMS or Phone call
      Text message/SMS or phone calls are convenient but are extremely vulnerable to theft, hackers and other attacks.

      If you choose to use this less secure option, enter a phone number at which you can get phone calls or text messages. If you have a landline, you must receive your security code by phone call. login.gov cannot send security codes to extensions or voicemails.

      We will send a unique security code to that phone number each time you sign into your account.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/5-phonenumber.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Add a phone number help image" />

      Each security code expires after 10 minutes and can only be used once. If you don’t enter the security code within 10 minutes, just request a new code. Each code is only good once, so no one can steal one you’ve already used.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/text-confirmation-code.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Phone text confirmation code help image" />

      Type the security code into the field. That’s it! Every time you sign back into your login.gov account, you will receive a new security code that you need to enter. You’ll get the option each time you sign in to get a security code by a phone call or by SMS.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/6-enter-one-time-security-code.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Enter security code help image" />

      #### Backup codes
      While backup codes are an accessible option for users who do not have phone access, these codes are the least secure option for two-factor authentication. Backup codes must be printed or written down which makes them more vulnerable to theft and phishing.

      If you choose to select this less secure option, login.gov will generate a set of 10 codes. After you sign in with your username and password, you will be prompted for a code. Each code may only be used once, once the 10th code has been used you will be prompted to download a new list. Treat your recovery codes with the same level of attention as you would your password.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/backup_codes.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Backup codes generated help image" />
    no-phone-or-other-authentication-method: |-
      login.gov requires users to set up two forms of two-factor authentication methods when creating an account. However, if you do not have access to a phone, authentication application, security key, or government employee ID (PIV/CAC card), you can set up your account with only backup codes.

      Warning: Setting up your account with backup codes as your only authentication method is not recommended. If you ever lose your backup codes, you will not be able to sign in to your account.

      When you are creating your account, you will reach the “Secure your account” page. This is where you must choose you primary authentication method. If you do not have access to any of the other options, select “Backup Codes” and click “Continue”.

      Download, print, copy, or write down your back up codes and save them in a secure place. Then, click “Continue”. Note: you must click “Continue” to activate your backup codes. If you do not and you exit the page instead, you will not be able to use that set of backup codes to sign in later.

      On the “Add another method” page, select “I don’t have any of the above” and click “Continue”

      You will then be finished creating your account. Each time you sign in using login.gov, you will be asked to enter one of your backup codes. After you use the 10th code, you will be given a new set of backup codes to save and use.
    email-address-confirmation-not-received: |-
      If you didn't receive a confirmation email, check your spam filter. Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If so, you can always make another account with your correct email address.

      - If you mistyped your address, you can create a new account.
      - If you are certain you entered the correct address, choose “send again” to get a new confirmation email.
    email-address-is-already-in-use: |-
      Confirming access to an email address is the first step in creating a login.gov account. If you received a notice that there is already a login.gov account associated with your email address, but you don't remember creating it, use your email address to go through the [password reset process and sign in](site.baseurl/help/signing-in/forgot-my-password).

      Please submit a [support ticket](site.baseurl/contact) if you are sure you did not create an account.

      [What is two-factor authentication](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/two-factor-authentication/)

      [Why do I have to use login.gov?](site.baseurl/help/privacy-and-security/why-do-i-have-to-use-logingov/)
    creating-a-strong-password: |-
      Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.

      When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and common misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your company name or your spouse's or children's names - and even your pet - as well as other personal information such as your age or birth date.

      If you're already signed in, and you're trying to change your password, email, or phone, you will be prompted to enter your current password before you can make the changes.

      But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left unattended. In that case, for your security, we sign you out after three failed attempts.
    personal-key: |-
      A personal key is a 16-character secret code that login.gov gives you after you verify their identity. It’s used to encrypt your data (think of it as a key to your secret information). You don’t need it every time you sign in, but you will need it if you reset your password.

      Remember, it’s the key to your personal information, so make sure you keep it in a safe place where it can’t be lost or stolen.

      Note: You’ll only get and need a personal key if you verified your identity on your login.gov account (only some government applications require identity verification).

      **You need your personal key if you reset your password**
      To keep your information safe, your password and your personal key are the only two ways to decrypt your data (the only two keys to your secret information).
      - If you reset your password, you’ll have to enter your personal key.
      - If you lose both your password and your personal key, you’ll have to verify your identity again.

      **Personal keys are not used for 2FA anymore**
      In the past, we gave users a personal key to use as a two-factor authentication method. It was a way to sign in to your account if you lost or changed your phone number. However, we’ve now removed the ability to use personal keys as an authentication method because they are easily lost or stolen.

      If you still have the option to use personal key for two-factor authentication, you’ll be asked to set up a different authentication method the next time you sign in. You can choose from phone SMS or voice call, authenticator app, security key, government or military employee ID (PIV/CAC), or backup codes. After you set up your new authentication method, you won’t be able to use personal key as an authentication method anymore.

    what-are-backup-codes: Backup codes are a set of 10 generated codes you can use as a second authentication mechanism. If you lose your phones or otherwise can't get codes via text, voice call, or authentication app, you can use backup codes to sign in. If you don't have your security key, you can also use these codes to sign in.

      After you’ve used a backup code to sign in, it will become inactive. Once you have used all of your backup codes a new set will be generated for you. You can also generate a new set of 10 codes from the account page. After creating a new set, the old set will automatically become inactive.

      We recommend you store your codes in a safe manner. Like the security codes sent to your phone, backup codes are only valuable to someone if they manage to also steal your password.

    two-factor-authentication: |-
      login.gov uses two-factor authentication (2FA) to keep accounts secure. This means that, each time you sign in, you must use something you know and something you have. This makes your account safer by making it much harder for others to break into it.

      1. The ‘something you know’ is your password. We’ll ask you to create a strong password (at least 12 characters long) when you create your account.


      2. The ‘something you have’ is your two-factor authentication method. You’ll be able to choose between the following options when you create your account.
        - Phone: Get security codes by text message (SMS) or phone call
        - [Authentication app](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/authentication-application/): Get codes from an app on your phone, computer, or tablet
        - [Security key](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/security-key/): Use a security key that you have. It’s a physical device that you plug in or that is built in to your computer or phone (it often looks like a USB flash drive).
        - Government employee ID: Insert your government or military PIV or CAC card and enter your PIN
        - Backup codes: We’ll give you 10 codes to use and keep in a safe place. You can use backup codes as your only authentication method, if you don’t have any of the other options.

      We’ll ask you to set up at least two different two-factor authentication methods for your account. You won’t have to use both every time you sign in, but it helps make sure you don’t lose access to your account (for example, if you lose your phone and need to change your phone number).

    authentication-application: |-
      If you don’t want to receive security codes by text or phone call, you can set up an authentication app on your device to generate security codes.
        1. Choose a device, such as a computer or mobile device (phone or tablet), on which you can install apps.
        2. Download and install an authentication app to your device. Some popular options include:
          - Android options: [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, [Authy](https://authy.com){:target="_blank"}, [LastPass](https://lastpass.com){:target="_blank"}, [1Password](https://1password.com){:target="_blank"}
          - iOS options: [Google Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8){:target="_blank"}, [Authy](https://authy.com){:target="_blank"}, [LastPass](https://lastpass.com){:target="_blank"}, [1Password](https://1password.com){:target="_blank"}
          - Windows apps: [1Password](https://1password.com){:target="_blank"}, [OTP Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/otp-manager/9nblggh6hngn){:target="_blank"}
          - Mac apps: [1Password](https://1password.com){:target="_blank"}, [OTP Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otp-manager/id928941247?mt=12){:target="_blank"}
          - Chrome extensions: [Authenticator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai?hl=en){:target="_blank"}
        3. Open a new browser and sign into your login.gov account at [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/). *NOTE*: If you do not have access to your configured two-factor authentication mechanism, you may be able to sign in using your personal key if you were assigned one and it has never been used.
        4. Select “enable” next to Authentication app and follow the instructions to scan or enter a code associating your authentication app with your account.

      You will now be able to use the one-time passcodes generated by the application each time you sign in instead of receiving a text message or a phone call. If you are having difficulty setting up the authentication app, you will need to contact the app developer directly for assistance.
    security-key: |-
      A security key is an authentication device that strengthens account security when used in addition to a password when signing in. Using a security key is better than receiving codes via phone call or text message because these codes can be phished or intercepted. When you use a security key to sign in, the key will check to make sure you are on the official login.gov website.

      A security key is usually a piece of physical hardware, like a USB, that you can carry on your keychain. You can also use supporting software, such as a web browser extension or other services. When choosing a security key, look for compatibility with the [FIDO standard](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/){:target="_blank"}.
    phone-didnt-get-a-security-code: |-
      If you didn't receive a security code, check whether you entered your phone number correctly.

      - Did you enter a wrong phone number? Look for the option to enter it again. If you have a non-U.S. number, make sure you select the correct country code.
      - If you have a landline, please make sure to pick the “Phone call” option under “How would you like to receive your security code?” We cannot send a text message to landlines.
      - If you have an international phone number, make sure you select to receive the security code by text message. login.gov does not support sending security codes to international landlines at this time.
      - If the number you’ve entered is correct, make sure you have service and request the code again. You can receive the code by text message or by a phone call.
    multiple-accounts-to-verifying-my-identity-for: |-
      Government agencies decide for themselves how they want to interact with the public. You were sent to login.gov because the service or program you want to use has chosen to take advantage of the efficiency and security of login.gov as a shared technology platform. Once you have finished at login.gov, you will be directed back to the agency.

      We hope login.gov is a convenient and secure option for you. However, if you prefer not to use login.gov, you can always access government services. You'll find more information at your agency.
    email-address-confirmation-link-is-invalid: |-
      Email confirmation links expire after 24 hours. Select “resend” to get a new confirmation email or start the process over by selecting “create account” and entering your email address.

      If you have requested more than one confirmation email, you must use the most recent email. All links in older emails will be invalid.

      If the confirmation link still does not work and you have done the steps outlined above, it is possible your email provider has scrambled the link. One way to determine if this has happened is by copying and pasting the confirmation link into your browser. If there are any unusual symbols or words in the link, remove them and hit enter.

      For additional help, [please submit a support ticket] (https://login.gov/contact).
  authentication-methods:
    which-authentication-method-should-i-use: |-
      Login.gov uses two-factor authentication (TFA), or multi-factor authentication (MFA), as an added layer of protection to secure your most sensitive information.

      Two-factor authentication can be done in multiple ways and each has a different level of security. You can choose between text messages, phone calls, an authentication application, a security key, or backup codes. Government employees can also use their PIV or CAC cards.

      We encourage you to review the available options and select the most secure option for you.

  verifying-your-identity:
    why-do-i-need-to-verify-my-identity: |-
      Some government applications that use login.gov require users to verify their identities. This means that you must prove that you are who you say you are. By doing this, we make sure that only the right people get access to sensitive information.

      You will only be asked to verify your identity the first time you sign in to certain government applications.

      You only need to verify your identity once for your login.gov account (after you verify your identity with login.gov for one government application, you don’t need to do it again for other government applications).
    how-to-verify-my-identity: |-
      If a government application requires identity verification, login.gov will ask you to verify your identity the first time you sign in to it. You will need to have your state-issued ID (like your driver’s license) or a picture of the front and the back of it. Use the following steps to verify your identity on login.gov:
      1. When you are signing in or creating an account, you will see the “We need to verify your identity” page. Click on “Get started”.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/verify-my-identity-1.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" />
      2. On the “How would you like to upload your state issued ID?” page, choose to upload images of your ID from your computer or from your phone (take a picture with your phone’s camera or upload an image from your phone’s photo library).
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/verify-my-identity-2.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" />

      6. Re-enter your login.gov password

      If we are able to verify your identity, you will see a confirmation page and be able to enter the government application.
    dont-have-a-state-issued-id: |-
      At this time, you cannot verify your identity on login.gov without a state-issued ID. We’re currently working to add more ways to verify your identity.

      In the meantime, please contact your government application’s help center to find out what you can do.
    multiple-accounts-to-verifying-my-identity-for: |-
      You can only verify your identity for one account. If you have more than one login.gov account, you can combine them by deleting one account and then adding that email address to the other. Before you do this, remember that you will have to relink any government applications that were connected to the account(s) you are deleting. Also, you can only add a maximum of ten email addresses to a single login.gov account.

      Delete an account
        1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/){:target="_blank"}

    does-logingov-share-my-information: login.gov cannot share any information with
      other government agencies without the user's permission. Not even login.gov
      administrators can decrypt or access a user's personal information without the
      user's password.
    what-is-phishing: Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into sharing your
      password or other personal information online. Phishing is typically done through
      email, ads, or by sites that look similar to sites you already use. For example,
      you might get an email that looks like it’s from login.gov asking you to confirm
      your email, password, security code, or personal key. A security key makes it
      harder for this to occur because there are no codes that you can mistakenly
      share with an attacker. The security key will also make sure you’re entering
      information on the official login.gov website.

      Your login.gov email address must be the same as your SAM.gov email address to successfully link your SAM profile to your login.gov account. If you have already created a login.gov account, but with an email address that is different from your SAM.gov registered email you can do the following:
        1. **Update your SAM.gov email**: Before 6:00 pm EST on Friday, June 29th, you can update your SAM.gov email to the email address you used to create your login.gov account. When you sign on to SAM.gov using login.gov for the first time, your profile will automatically link.
        2. **Change your login.gov email**: You can change your login.gov email to match your SAM.gov email address. You must change your login.gov email before signing into SAM using login.gov. Changing your email will not affect your profiles with other government applications, and once you’ve signed into SAM.gov and linked your profile, you can change your login.gov email back to the original email used. To change your login.gov email, do the following:
        3. **Create another login.gov account**: You can also create a new login.gov account using the same email registered with SAM.
    my-email-address-used-for-sam-is-not-available: If you no longer have access to the email you used to create

    reset-or-relink-my-logingov-account-for-sam: |-
      If you cannot sign into your SAM account because you’ve permanently lost access to your two-factor authentication methods you can reset your account by deleting it.

      Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will allow you to use the same email address and set up new authentication methods. Your information/applications will not be deleted, however, deleting will remove any agency applications you have linked to your account, including the link to your SAM profile. You must follow the below steps to relink your account:

      1. To delete your account, sign in at [https://sam.gov/](https://sam.gov/). When you are prompted to enter your security code, scroll to the bottom of the page to the section that says “If you can't use any of the authentication methods above, you can reset your preferences by deleting your account,” and follow that link.
      2. Read through all the information carefully to make sure deleting your account is the only way to reset your account settings. select "Yes, continue deletion" to proceed.
      3. You will immediately receive an email confirmation that your delete request was received. As a security measure, you will receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours after the initial confirmation arrives.
      4. After you delete your account, go to [https://sam.gov/](https://sam.gov/) to create a new account.
      5. If you have used the correct email address, your SAM profile will automatically link once you’ve signed in.
    cant-sign-in-or-reset-my-password-sam-account: |-
      You must have a login.gov account to sign into SAM.gov. If you don’t have a login.gov account, you need to create one. **Your old SAM.gov username and password won’t work anymore.**

      **To create a login.gov account:**

        1. Start from the [sam.gov](https://www.sam.gov/){:target="_blank"} portal and select the Log in button.
        2. Choose Create an Account to start creating a login.gov account.
        3. Confirm an email address during the account set up. If you are a returning SAM.gov user, you must use the email address registered with SAM.gov to link your profile information to your login.gov account.
        4. Create a new password.
        5. Configure at least one more authentication mechanism (phone, authentication app, backup codes, or security keys)

      Once you’ve finished setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to SAM.gov where you should see your profile. You need to use your login.gov email address, password, and security code every time you want to sign into SAM.gov.
    my-sam-information-is-not-there: |-
      If you are an existing SAM user and don’t see your SAM.gov profile after signing in, this means you did not use the same email address you registered with SAM.gov. To update your email address to match your SAM.gov registered email you’ll need to:

        1. Go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and
        2. select “Sign In” to access your account
        3. select “edit” next to your email
        4. Enter the correct email address and select “update”
        5. You will be sent a confirmation email. You must open and select the confirmation link to finish updating your email

        If you can’t remember the email you registered with SAM.gov, you can contact the Federal Service Desk at 866-606-8220 (toll fee) or 334-206-7828 (internationally) for assistance. You may also submit your request via web form at [www.fsd.gov](https://www.fsd.gov/){:target="_blank"}.

        If you no longer have access to the email you used to create your SAM.gov profile, you will need to create a new SAM.gov profile with your new login.gov account.
    why-sam-uses-logingov: |-
      login.gov uses two-factor authentication, and stronger passwords, that meet new [National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"} requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you’ll get an extra layer of security to help protect your SAM.gov profile against password compromises.
        - **Do I have to create a login.gov account to sign into SAM?**
          You must create a new account with login.gov. This is a one-time step. For existing SAM users, you should use your existing SAM.gov email address. For new users, you will be able to create a new SAM profile once you complete the login.gov authentication.
        - **What will happen to my SAM Profile?**
          Nothing will happen to the information stored in your SAM.gov account and profile. If you use the same email to create your login.gov profile, you will keep all of your records, data access requests, and saved searches. If you use a new email address, nothing will happen to your SAM.gov profile, but you will be unable to access it.
        - **What email address should I use to create a login.gov account?**
          If you are an existing SAM user, use the same email address you registered within SAM.gov so we can automatically link your SAM.gov profile to your login.gov account. If you use a different email address, we won't be able to link your profile automatically.

    phone-or-authentication-methods-not-available: |-
      If you don’t have or can’t use your authentication method (your phone, backup codes, authentication app, or personal key), you can still sign in to your account.

      If you lost access to your default authentication method, but still have access to one of your backup authentication methods, use the steps below:
        1. Sign in with your email and password
        2. Click on “Choose another option”
        3. Select the option that you have available
        4. Click on “Continue” and follow the steps to sign in

      If you lost access to all of your authentication methods forever, you will need to reset your account. Use the steps below:
        1. Delete your account
        2. If you are a USAJOBS users, contact USAJOBS to unlink your old account
        3. Create a new account using the same email address

      Try to sign in as usual and ask to have your password reset. Then, enter the email address you believe you used to create your account. If we have your email address in our records, we will send instructions on how to reset your password. Check your email in a few minutes for these instructions.
    if-i-dont-have-my-phone-with-me-can-i-still-sign-in: |-
      If you selected phone call or text message as your second factor it is necessary to have your phone in order to get the security code to sign in. For this reason it's useful to select multiple authentication mechanisms in case you do not have access to one. If you have configured more than one second factor method, once you sign in with your email address and password select “Choose another authentication method” if the first option is using your phone. This will give you the option to select any other authentication methods you have previously configured.

      If you were provided with a personal key and have not yet used the one that was last generated you can also select the personal key option. Enter the personal key that was last generated for you. If you have successfully entered your personal key, you will be prompted to configure a new second factor then redirected to your original destination. Because personal keys are being retired as a second authentication method, once you use your last generated personal key you will no longer be assigned a new one. Instead you must use backup codes, an authentication application, or a security key.

      We encourage you to configure multiple authentication methods — this way, you’ll be able to access your account even if your device is stolen or your online accounts are hacked.
    reset-password-link-is-invalid: |-
      Reset password links expire after 6 hours. If this has happened, select “Resend” to get a new reset password link or select “forgot password” and enter your email address.

      If you have requested more than one reset password link, you must use the link in the most recent email. All links in older emails will be invalid.

      If the reset password link still does not work and you have done the steps outlined above, it is possible your email provider has scrambled the link. One way to determine if this has happened is by copying and pasting the confirmation link into your browser. If there are any unusual symbols or words in the link, remove them and hit enter.

      For additional help, you can [submit a support ticket] (https://login.gov/contact)
    how-to-sign-in: |-
      Every time you sign in to your account, you will need your email address, your password, and access to one of the two-factor authentication methods you set up. After you enter your email address and password to sign in, login.gov will ask you to authenticate (enter a security code sent to your phone by voice or text, enter the security code from your authentication application, enter a backup code, use your security key, or use your government PIV/CAC card).
    locked-out-of-account: |-
      There are several ways you can be temporarily locked out of login.gov.
        - You will be unable to login for 10 minutes if you incorrectly enter your security code 3 times.
        - You will be unable to login for 10 minutes if you request more than 10 security codes in a 5 minute time period.
    reset-password-email-not-received: If you didn't receive
      a reset email, check your spam filter. If you add “no-reply@login.gov” to your
      contact list, your email provider will not send it to spam. Alternatively, you
      may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If you are confident you
      entered the correct address, choose "Send again" to get a new password reset
      email. If you are still not receiving emails, we recommend you contact your
      email provider about the issue or check your account settings if you are forwarding
      your email.
    phone-didnt-get-a-security-code: |-
      If you didn’t receive a security code, check whether you entered your phone number correctly.
        - Did you enter a wrong phone number? Look for the option to enter it again. If you have a non-U.S. number, make sure you select the correct country code.
        - If you have a landline, please make sure to pick the “Phone call” option under “How would you like to receive your security code?” We cannot send a text message to landlines.
        - If you have an international phone number, make sure you select to receive the security code by text message. login.gov does not support sending security codes by phone call to international numbers at this time.
        - If it's the right number, make sure you have service and request the code again. You can receive the code by text message or by a phone call.
    personal-key-not-working: |-
      A personal key is a 16-character secret code that login.gov gives you after you verify their identity. If you verified your identity on your account and later had to reset your password, you’ll be asked for your personal key.

      **If your personal key is not working**
      - Double check to make sure you entered it correctly. Don’t worry about characters that are hard to tell apart (like O and 0), they mean the same thing to us.
      - Make sure it’s your most recent personal key. Personal keys can only be used one time, so if you’ve used it once already, we gave you a new one.

      If it still isn’t working, click on the link at the bottom of the page to verify your identity again.

      **Personal key as an authentication method**
      In the past, we also gave users a personal key to use as a two-factor authentication method. It was a way to sign in to your account if you lost or changed your phone number. However, we’ve now removed the ability to use personal keys as an authentication method because they are easily lost or stolen.

      If you still have the option to use a personal key, that’s because you haven’t signed in since we made the change. After you sign in with your email, password, and personal key or one-time password sent to your phone, you’ll be required to set up another authentication method. You can choose from phone SMS or voice call, authenticator app, security key, government or military employee ID (PIV/CAC), or backup codes. After you set up your new authentication method, you won’t be able to use personal key as authentication method again.

      If you don’t have one of you authentication methods to sign in, you’ll need to [reset your account](site.baseurl/help/signing-in/phone-or-authentication-methods-not-available/).

    security-code-not-working: Every time you sign in you will need to enter
      a security code that is sent to your phone either by a text message or a phone
      call. The security code you receive expires after 10 minutes and is only valid
      for one use. If you miss entering the security code within the 10 minutes or
      you missed the phone call, you can request a new security code. Each security
      code is only good once, so make sure you are using the most recent security
      code. You can only request 3 security codes every 15 minutes, but otherwise,
      you can request as many codes as you need.

    my-usajobs-information-is-not-there: |-
      If USAJOBS can’t find your profile information, you’ll be signed in as Guest.

       To find your USAJOBS profile, follow these steps:

         1. Sign into USAJOBS
         2. Select the “find existing profile” button
         3. Enter your email address and select “send email”
         4. Check your email and follow the instructions to confirm your account.

       If you receive an email that says the email address is not associated with a USAJOBS account, try to link your profile using a different email.

       If you are unable to link your profile or you no longer have access to the email address you used to create your USAJOBS profile, you can select “lost access to your email addresses” to contact the USAJOBS Help Center for additional support or use this link: [https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/faq/account/no-profile/](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/faq/account/no-profile/)
    reset-or-relink-my-logingov-account-for-usajobs: |-
      If you cannot sign in to your USAJOBS profile because you’ve permanently lost access to your authentication methods, you can reset your account by deleting it and relinking a new one.

      Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will let you use the same email address and set up new authentication methods. However, if you delete your login.gov account, you will not be able to sign in to USAJOBS (or any other government application that is linked to your login.gov account) until you create a new account and relink it. It will take at least 24 hours to delete your account.

      ### Delete and unlink your login.gov profile from USAJOBS
      1. First, sign in at [https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/){:target="_blank"} with your username and password. When asked for your authentication method, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on “Choose another authentication method.” On the next page, scroll down to “If you can't use any of these security options above, you can reset your preferences by deleting your account.” and click on the link.
      2. Read through all the information carefully to make sure deleting your account is the only way to reset your account settings and click on “Yes, continue deletion” to proceed.
      3. You will immediately receive an email confirmation that your delete request was received.
      4. As a security measure, you will receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours after the initial confirmation arrives.
      5. While you are waiting for the second email notification, you must contact the USAJOBS helpdesk to unlink your profile. Go to the [USAJOBS Help Center on login.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/faq/account/login-gov/){:target="_blank"} and click on the “Contact Us” button located at the bottom of the page. Do not create a new login.gov account until you have received confirmation that your profile has been unlinked. You will need to provide the following information about your profile to the USAJOBS helpdesk:
        * Email address
        * First, middle, and last name (if applicable, also include suffix (Jr., Sr., III, etc.) and maiden name)
        * Mailing and home address (include any past or present addresses that you’ve listed in your profile)
        * Phone numbers (include any past or present phone numbers you’ve listed in your profile)
        * Answers to your security questions (Secret Question 1-3)
      6. The USAJOBS helpdesk will send you an email confirming that your profile has been unlinked. That email will also provide guidance for regaining access to your account.

      ### Create a new login.gov profile and link it to USAJOBS
      1. Go to [https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/){:target="_blank"}, click on “Sign in”, click on “Create an account”, and follow the steps to create a new login.gov account. Make sure you use the same email address as the account you just deleted (the email address you use for your USAJOB account).
      2. If you followed these steps in this order and used the correct email, your profile will automatically link.

      NOTE: Do not create a new login.gov account until your profile has been unlinked. You must first unlink your account before creating a new one. If you do not unlink your account before you create a new one, we will not be able to link your accounts.

      If you have any questions about linking your account, please contact the [USAJOBS helpdesk](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/faq/account/login-gov/){:target="_blank"}.
    how-to-receive-the-security-code: |-
      You can choose to receive the one time security code via text or phone call if you have a U.S. based cell phone. Landlines can only receive a phone call. If you’re outside the U.S., most phone numbers can only receive a text.
    what-email-address-should-i-use: To keep your USAJOBS profile information, you need
      to use your primary or secondary USAJOBS email when you create your login.gov
      account. When you use the same email address, USAJOBS will automatically link
      your profile to the login.gov account. If you use a different email address
      when signing up for login.gov, USAJOBS won't be able to automatically link your
      profile. But, you can use your USAJOBS primary or secondary email address to
      help you search for your profile.
    what-will-happen-to-my-usajobs-profile: |-
      Nothing will happen to the information stored in your USAJOBS profile. You’ll keep all of your applications, saved searches and saved jobs.

      Once you set up a login.gov account, we’ll link it back to your USAJOBS profile. The only difference is you’ll use your login.gov email address, password and security code to sign into USAJOBS.

    heading_10: Implementation
    heading_11: Resources
    heading_2: 'You might not need to implement an identity system if:'
    heading_3: To answer this, ask
    heading_4: What kinds of resources do you already have to identify customers?
    heading_5: To answer this, ask
    heading_6: What is a consumer identity management system?
    heading_7: What is an identity?
    heading_8: How does identity and access management work?
    heading_9: What does having an identity record enable?
    p_1: It’s worth assessing what you really need before beginning implementation.
      Not all information requires an identity system to manage access. You can protect
      the privacy of users and reduce the security risk to your systems by avoiding
      any unnecessary collection of personally identifiable information — this even
      includes contact details.
    p_2: Your agency may already have mission-specific information and resources that
      can be used to identify customers. By integrating resources you know and trust,
      you can increase the reliability of identification.
    p_3: When you’re at home and someone knocks at your door it’s easy enough to decide
      whether or not to answer. Based on your knowledge of who’s outside, you can
      decide whether to open the door. Is the person outside a friend? A mail carrier
      or other expected service provider? A complete stranger? Online, the question
      of deciding “who’s there” is much harder. Consumer identity management systems
      make it easier for system administrators to decide whether or not to open the
      door, and how wide.
    p_4: In the world of security, “identity” has a very specific technical meaning
      that differs from a plain English sense. An “identity” in technical terms is
      a special kind of record — a bundle of different types of data that together
      describes only one system user [NIST 800-63-3]. That data can include references
      to official government records, such as driver’s license numbers and registered
      birth dates, as well as more mutable data such as email addresses and usernames.
      Physical attributes such as fingerprints and DNA can also be part of an identity
      record.
    p_5: System administrators assign access privileges to each identity record. These
      privileges authorize certain activities and forbid others. To “open the door”
      safely, however, administrators need confidence that the users knocking at the
      door are who they say they are.
    p_6: To give the system and its administrators confidence in their identities,
      users need to prove their identities through an activity called authentication.
      Users authenticate themselves by presenting evidence linking themselves to records.
      To do that, users first help the system validate their record — for example,
      by typing in a username. Then users hand over the evidence — often, passwords
      or other information only the real person would know.
    p_7: 'Identity systems don’t just benefit system administrators. Users can do
      some very handy things with an authenticated digital identity. Here’s a small
      list:'
    ul_1:
      li_1: You do not need to have an ongoing relationship with users.
      li_2: Transactions don’t depend upon personal information being accurate.
      li_3: You can rely on other forms of security.
    ul_2:
      li_1:
        content: What transactions will users need?
        p_1: Will the transactions be ongoing, as when users bookmark benefits or
          grant applications to fill out later, then return repeatedly to check the
          application status? Or will they be a one-time or infrequent, as when people
          download medical or financial records?
      li_2:
        content: What kind of information do you need to protect your customers?
        p_1: Do you need full name and other personal information so that users can
          access private information? Or do you only need to verify that a user fits
          in certain categories, such as the veterans category or the senior citizens
          category?
      li_3:
        content: What sort of crime might access to this information make possible?
        p_1: Information that seems innocent on its own might still be valuable to
          fraudsters and other criminals in combination with other easily accessed
          information.
      li_4:
        content: What other means of security are available?
        p_1: Postal tracking numbers, for example, are not secrets because the package
          will only be delivered to a specific address. The safety of the delivery
          rests on the security of the building and the conduct of the delivery person,
          not on the secrecy of the number itself.
    ul_3:
      li_1:
        content: What resources are unique to your agency?
        p_1: Individuals’ confidential interactions with government agencies can generate
          a trail of metadata. Used carefully, that metadata can facilitate identity
          verification based on knowledge of those activities. Other government organizations
          serve as authoritative repositories of biometric data available for internal
          use. Some agencies may have physical locations that customers can visit.
    ul_4:
      li_1:
        span_1: Pre-filling online forms with verified information speeds up application
          processing.
        span_2: There’s less redundant effort, and users don’t need to worry about
          basic errors.
      li_2:
        span_1: Authenticated users can access and download data the system holds
          about them, such as account activity.
        span_2: With a verified legal identity, the user can access very sensitive
          medical or financial records and even download them.
      li_3:
        span_1: Identity systems can protect your privacy.
        span_2: If you need to be 21 or older to access a service, you can authorize
          an identity system to confirm your age without sharing your exact birth
          date.

  content: |-
    This privacy notice describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect
    your personal information, as well as your obligation to disclose it.

    Our goal is to protect your personal information, and we will not share
    it without your permission. For example, we will encrypt your personal
    information in transit and at rest and ask you before sharing your data
    with a partner agency. However, there may be circumstances where we are
    required to share certain data. For example: if the information is relevant
    and necessary for an authorized law enforcement purpose; in order to
    respond to a breach; or to assist another agency as it responds to a
    breach. For additional information, see the [system of record notice number GSA/TTS-1](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/10/2017-16852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}
    that GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) published on August 10, 2017.

    ### Privacy Act statement

    #### Authorities

    The information you provide to access your login.gov account is
    collected pursuant to 6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E), the [E-Government Act of 2002 (44 USC § 3501)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ347/html/PLAW-107publ347.htm){:target="_blank"},
    and 40 USC § 501.

    #### Purpose

    The information that you submit is used to create or update your
    login.gov account. Once you create an account, with your consent,
    login.gov will share your email address with the partner agency to
    provide online access to government information and services.
    Additionally, if you’re accessing a government application that
    requires identity proofing, the additional information you submit is
    used to verify your identity.

    #### Disclosure

    You decide what information to give us. However, failure to provide
    complete and accurate information may delay access to the partner agency.
    The information you give login.gov will be shared with the applicable
    federal agency to provide access to information about you held by that
    agency as described in the associated [systems of records notices](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/10/2017-16852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}.
    Please note that the login.gov system will record certain session-level information
    about your use of the service, including but not limited to, web browser
    type and version, and the length of your session. This information allows
    login.gov better understand how the site is being used and how it can be
    made more helpful.

    #### Storage

    All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s
    [Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"}.
    You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number
    by accessing it in your account. You should choose an email address
    through which you would like to receive correspondence from any partner
    agency whose services or information you might access. Changing that
    address will redirect all email correspondence with any partner agency.

    Similarly, you should choose the number of a phone that you have access
    to in order to receive and respond with the one-time password(s) that
    are sent to that number.

    Your email address and phone number will be maintained for at least six
    years in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration
    (NARA) guidance. However, GSA is authorized to maintain the information
    for longer if it is required for business use. login.gov must be able
    to provide users access to information and services at partner agencies
    and therefore may have a business need to retain the information longer

    Solving real problems for potential users should be the focus for any system, and is doubly important when building an identity management system. Throughout this playbook, you’ll see how satisfying user needs is a guiding principle in every decision made.

    One of the first steps you should take is identifying your core users. For login.gov, we’ve identified two groups as our core users: the general public and tech people inside government agencies. The goal for the system itself is to support and address the needs of the general public. To put it plainly, we want to make sure that our system makes people comfortable with logging in to government services. The public needs to feel confident that login.gov behaves as expected and will not disappoint them. The system also needs to address users’ entire experience as they try to accomplish their goals. Because identity verification and authentication is technologically complex, it’s not unlikely that even the most tech-savvy people could get stuck if their phone is lost or a system has errors. So in support of each agency’s mission, architects and designers of consumer identity management systems need to anticipate likely sticking points so that people don’t lose access to the services and benefits.

    Agencies should figure out what portion of the public they serve and how services can be built to address their needs specifically. This will help agency integration teams understand what they need if they decide to implement the login.gov platform or any other consumer identity management system.

    Finally, you should continuously test designs and tools as they’re ready to share and then adjust your project based on what you learn. In some cases, we learn that the current best practices aren’t good enough. And in those cases we’re pushed to try out new ways to give the users the best experience possible. That process involves further testing, educating users, and a willingness to iterate.

    There are a number of specific design methods we practice to remain user-centered, and you can read about all of them, and use them yourself, by reviewing the [18F Design Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}.
  p_2: |-
    [Working transparently](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13){:target="_blank"} and creating a transparent system should be the way any agency works when building or implementing an identity management system. To execute this principle with login.gov, we’re building the platform so that interested parties can advise us on best practices and so that we remain accountable to the public and to our partners across the government. Further, it means building a system that tells users what it does with their information to create accountability and build trust. We’re engaging users and other interested parties through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp){:target="_blank"} and working on creating public forums where people can discuss our work.

    To make an identity management system transparent for end users, the system you build should include features that educate people about how the system works, why it works that way, and how they can control what’s happening with their data. You should also let users know what information is needed by an agency when logging in to a service. It’s also important to tell users what information your systems will store and if any data is shared with other agencies. If people using the system aren’t comfortable with information sharing, they shouldn’t be forced to participate.

    login.gov is working to implement all of these transparency-enhancing features. Further, to help people understand all that is happening, we’re creating a privacy policy that explains how data is shared and what it means to opt out.
  p_3: |-
    Technology and standards for identity verification and authentication can change rapidly. Consumer identity management systems should readily adapt to changing standards and react to new security threats. To make adapting to new policies and capabilities possible, it’s a good practice to build products using agile methods and with changing versions in mind. In other words, plan for modifications to help your identity service be as up-to-date as possible and compliant with current standards and policies.

    We’re embracing this principle for every aspect of the project in building login.gov.

    [Read this guide](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/index.html){:target="_blank"} to agile principles and practices put together by the 18F team to learn more about what it means to work in an agile way.
  p_4: |-
    Consumer identity management systems store personal information about users so that people don’t have to repeat the verification and authentication processes over and over again. However, collecting and storing personal information raises ethical and legal questions that system designers and developers need to consider. Often, what comes to mind first are technical questions about security: protecting information from unauthorized or illegal access and uses. However, we also need to worry about authorized, legal uses of personal information that violate users’ expectations of privacy. Users of login.gov need to be sure that we’re handling their personal information respectfully and appropriately.

    The first step is only collecting the information you absolutely need. And that’s what login.gov is doing. High-assurance identity verification for sensitive tasks does require extensive information collection. However, many activities don’t require high levels of assurance (LOA) and login.gov supports different LOA so agencies can clearly delineate their users who need lower levels of security from those with more sensitive needs while ensuring usability and data security. Minimizing the amount of information collected and stored not only lowers the security risk; it also reduces worries about re-use and disclosure for users.

    The next step is to give users as much control as possible over what information is shared. We believe firmly that people own their data, not us, and we will always act accordingly. If people aren’t comfortable with the data requirements for using a system, they should know they don’t have to sign up, and that there are other ways to accomplish their goals.

    As we design login.gov, we’re also working to educate users to help them safeguard their own data. We want people to understand why we have to ask for certain kinds of sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and how we’re using them.
  p_5: |-
    Figuring out who is trying to access personal information and making sure only authorized users can gain access to that information are the keys to consumer identity management. The reason systems like this exist is to secure the user’s identity from those looking to commit theft or fraud.

    Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.

    In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.

    In building login.gov, we’re adhering to standards put forward by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/){:target="_blank"} (NIST 800-63-3). Additionally we’re adhering to [government security best practices](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11){:target="_blank"} including FedRAMP, building in the open, conducting rigorous and routine security evaluations in addition to compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

    login.gov offers the public a single, secure, and private access to online federal services, eliminating the need to remember passwords for multiple systems.  It also reduces costs of developing or buying duplicative authentication and proofing solutions for agencies, so they can focus on their mission. The more agencies that adopt login.gov, the more taxpayers save. Through login.gov agencies can provide a more consistent customer experience by reducing duplicate accounts and encouraging a 21st Century IDEA compliant experience.
  p_3: |-
    login.gov offers secure two-factor authentication with widely available as well as unphishable methods. This service provides users with secure access to digital services at over 17 different government agencies with a single set of credentials. For you, this means leveraging the best security defined by NIST 800-63 Identity Assurance Level 1 and Authentication Assurance Level 2, and FedRAMP Moderate while complying with 21st Century Idea Act in a easy-to-use experience.

    login.gov identity verification builds on the security of our authentication service and provides a remote proofing experience using an individual’s state-issued ID rather than knowledge-based verification. Our remote proofing implementation complies with NIST’s IAL2. The login.gov verified accounts (IAL2/AAL2) allows applications to access verified attributes about a user such as a phone number and a social security number while maintaining user privacy by requiring the user’s consent and password to decrypt the data.

      # How to sign in to login.gov
      Every time you sign in to your login.gov account, you will need your email address, your password, and access to one of the two-factor authentication methods you set up.

      Follow these steps to sign in to login.gov.
        1. Enter your email address at [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov). 
        1. Enter your password.
        1. Click the “Sign in” button.
        1. Authenticate using one of the methods you set up. Options include:
            1. Entering a security code from your authentication application
            1. Using your security key
            1. Entering a security code that you receive by text or by phone call
            1. Entering a backup code
            1. Using your federal government employee or military ID (PIV or CAC)
        1. You will then be taken to your login.gov account page.

      # Forgot your password
      Follow these steps to reset your password.
      1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov).
      1. Select the “Forgot your password?” link near the bottom of the page.
      1. On the next screen, enter your email address.
      1. Click the “Continue” button.
      1. Check your email for a message from login.gov. 
      1. Click the “Reset your password” button in the message. This will take you back to the login.gov website.
      1. Enter your new password.
          Passwords must be at least 12 characters. That's it! There are no other restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 12 characters. Try using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize.  
          
          Your login.gov password should be different from passwords you use for other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same password for many accounts makes identity theft easier.
      1. Click the “Change password” button.

      # Locked out of login.gov account
      If you didn't receive a confirmation email, check your spam filter. Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If so, you can always make another account with your correct email address.

      - If you mistyped your address, you can create a new account.
      - If you are certain you entered the correct address, choose “send again” to get a new confirmation email.
    phone-or-authentication-methods-not-available: |-
      # Phone or authentication methods not available
      Confirming access to an email address is the first step in creating a login.gov account. If you received a notice that there is already a login.gov account associated with your email address, but you don't remember creating it, use your email address to go through the [password reset process and sign in](site.baseurl/help/signing-in/forgot-my-password).

      Please submit a [support ticket](site.baseurl/contact) if you are sure you did not create an account.

    forgot-your-email-address: |-
      # Forgot your email address
      Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.

      When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and common misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your company name or your spouse's or children's names - and even your pet - as well as other personal information such as your age or birth date.

      If you're already signed in, and you're trying to change your password, email, or phone, you will be prompted to enter your current password before you can make the changes.

      But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left unattended. In that case, for your security, we sign you out after three failed attempts.
    security-code-issues: |-
      # Security code issues
      A personal key is a 16-character secret code that login.gov gives you after you verify their identity. It’s used to encrypt your data (think of it as a key to your secret information). You don’t need it every time you sign in, but you will need it if you reset your password.

      Remember, it’s the key to your personal information, so make sure you keep it in a safe place where it can’t be lost or stolen.

      Note: You’ll only get and need a personal key if you verified your identity on your login.gov account (only some government applications require identity verification).

      **You need your personal key if you reset your password**
      To keep your information safe, your password and your personal key are the only two ways to decrypt your data (the only two keys to your secret information).
      - If you reset your password, you’ll have to enter your personal key.
      - If you lose both your password and your personal key, you’ll have to verify your identity again.

      **Personal keys are not used for 2FA anymore**
      In the past, we gave users a personal key to use as a two-factor authentication method. It was a way to sign in to your account if you lost or changed your phone number. However, we’ve now removed the ability to use personal keys as an authentication method because they are easily lost or stolen.

      If you still have the option to use personal key for two-factor authentication, you’ll be asked to set up a different authentication method the next time you sign in. You can choose from phone SMS or voice call, authenticator app, security key, government or military employee ID (PIV/CAC), or backup codes. After you set up your new authentication method, you won’t be able to use personal key as an authentication method anymore.

      # Password reset issues
      login.gov uses two-factor authentication (2FA) to keep accounts secure. This means that, each time you sign in, you must use something you know and something you have. This makes your account safer by making it much harder for others to break into it.

      1. The ‘something you know’ is your password. We’ll ask you to create a strong password (at least 12 characters long) when you create your account.
      2. The ‘something you have’ is your two-factor authentication method. You’ll be able to choose between the following options when you create your account.
        - Phone: Get security codes by text message (SMS) or phone call
        - [Authentication app](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/authentication-application/): Get codes from an app on your phone, computer, or tablet
        - [Security key](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/security-key/): Use a security key that you have. It’s a physical device that you plug in or that is built in to your computer or phone (it often looks like a USB flash drive).
        - Government employee ID: Insert your government or military PIV or CAC card and enter your PIN
        - Backup codes: We’ll give you 10 codes to use and keep in a safe place. You can use backup codes as your only authentication method, if you don’t have any of the other options.

      We’ll ask you to set up at least two different two-factor authentication methods for your account. You won’t have to use both every time you sign in, but it helps make sure you don’t lose access to your account (for example, if you lose your phone and need to change your phone number).

    heading_5: To answer this, ask
    heading_6: What is a consumer identity management system?
    heading_7: What is an identity?
    heading_8: How does identity and access management work?
    heading_9: What does having an identity record enable?
    p_1: It’s worth assessing what you really need before beginning implementation.
      Not all information requires an identity system to manage access. You can protect
      the privacy of users and reduce the security risk to your systems by avoiding
      any unnecessary collection of personally identifiable information — this even
      includes contact details.
    p_2: Your agency may already have mission-specific information and resources that
      can be used to identify customers. By integrating resources you know and trust,
      you can increase the reliability of identification.
    p_3: When you’re at home and someone knocks at your door it’s easy enough to decide
      whether or not to answer. Based on your knowledge of who’s outside, you can
      decide whether to open the door. Is the person outside a friend? A mail carrier
      or other expected service provider? A complete stranger? Online, the question
      of deciding “who’s there” is much harder. Consumer identity management systems
      make it easier for system administrators to decide whether or not to open the
      door, and how wide.
    p_4: In the world of security, “identity” has a very specific technical meaning
      that differs from a plain English sense. An “identity” in technical terms is
      a special kind of record — a bundle of different types of data that together
      describes only one system user [NIST 800-63-3]. That data can include references
      to official government records, such as driver’s license numbers and registered
      birth dates, as well as more mutable data such as email addresses and usernames.
      Physical attributes such as fingerprints and DNA can also be part of an identity
      record.
    p_5: System administrators assign access privileges to each identity record. These
      privileges authorize certain activities and forbid others. To “open the door”
      safely, however, administrators need confidence that the users knocking at the
      door are who they say they are.
    p_6: To give the system and its administrators confidence in their identities,
      users need to prove their identities through an activity called authentication.
      Users authenticate themselves by presenting evidence linking themselves to records.
      To do that, users first help the system validate their record — for example,
      by typing in a username. Then users hand over the evidence — often, passwords
      or other information only the real person would know.
    p_7: 'Identity systems don’t just benefit system administrators. Users can do
      some very handy things with an authenticated digital identity. Here’s a small
      list:'
    ul_1:
      li_1: You do not need to have an ongoing relationship with users.
      li_2: Transactions don’t depend upon personal information being accurate.
      li_3: You can rely on other forms of security.
    ul_2:
      li_1:
        content: What transactions will users need?
        p_1: Will the transactions be ongoing, as when users bookmark benefits or
          grant applications to fill out later, then return repeatedly to check the
          application status? Or will they be a one-time or infrequent, as when people
          download medical or financial records?
      li_2:
        content: What kind of information do you need to protect your customers?
        p_1: Do you need full name and other personal information so that users can
          access private information? Or do you only need to verify that a user fits
          in certain categories, such as the veterans category or the senior citizens
          category?
      li_3:
        content: What sort of crime might access to this information make possible?
        p_1: Information that seems innocent on its own might still be valuable to
          fraudsters and other criminals in combination with other easily accessed
          information.
      li_4:
        content: What other means of security are available?
        p_1: Postal tracking numbers, for example, are not secrets because the package
          will only be delivered to a specific address. The safety of the delivery
          rests on the security of the building and the conduct of the delivery person,
          not on the secrecy of the number itself.
    ul_3:
      li_1:
        content: What resources are unique to your agency?
        p_1: Individuals’ confidential interactions with government agencies can generate
          a trail of metadata. Used carefully, that metadata can facilitate identity
          verification based on knowledge of those activities. Other government organizations
          serve as authoritative repositories of biometric data available for internal
          use. Some agencies may have physical locations that customers can visit.
    ul_4:
      li_1:
        span_1: Pre-filling online forms with verified information speeds up application
          processing.
        span_2: There’s less redundant effort, and users don’t need to worry about
          basic errors.
      li_2:
        span_1: Authenticated users can access and download data the system holds
          about them, such as account activity.
        span_2: With a verified legal identity, the user can access very sensitive
          medical or financial records and even download them.
      li_3:
        span_1: Identity systems can protect your privacy.
        span_2: If you need to be 21 or older to access a service, you can authorize
          an identity system to confirm your age without sharing your exact birth

        ## Login.gov is committed to your privacy and security ## {#intro}

        This describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect your personal information. Protecting your information is our priority at login.gov.

        The information that you submit is used to create or update your login.gov account and give you access to login.gov’s partner agencies. When you provide your email address or other proof of identity like a state ID, we can be sure it’s really you and grant you access to the account — and keep the bad actors away. This proof, called an electronic identity assurance credential, is like putting a key into a lock and securely opens the door to the government agency’s application or service.

        ###  How we work with our partner agencies: ### {#how-we-work-with-our-partner-agencies}

        * Login.gov partners with government agencies to provide secure access to their website, application or service. The partner agency (e.g. United States Office of Personnel Management) selects the type of information we request from you.
            * We ask primarily for information to authenticate your account and/or prove your identity.
        * When you create a login.gov account, you consent to share personally identifiable  information (PII). The information that you need to share depends on the request of the partner agency.
            * For authentication to establish a secure account, we need your name, email address, and an authentication method. Your authentication method could be a phone number where we share a SMS code, USB Security Key or other options.
            * Identity proofing requires more sensitive information such as a social security number, address, phone number connected to your address, and U.S. based state ID or driver’s license.
        * When users visit login.gov, either to access their account or not, we anonymously aggregate some data. No individually identifying information is attached to this data. We aggregate information such as the pages visited, web browser type and version, and the length of your session to help us improve the login.gov experience.
            * For example;  If you experience an error and we know your web browser type and version, we can better identify how to fix your issue.
        * Stored information is encrypted at two levels. Encryption translates your data into code that is only accessible by you, the login.gov account holder.  This means you are the only one who can view and make changes to your account information.
            * The login.gov operators (i.e. our contact help center) cannot view your information or make any changes.
            * Information is stored and deleted according to the [National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) approved record schedule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01174/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-new-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}.

        Protecting your information is our priority. You can read below for a more detailed explanation of our privacy and security practices.

        You can read more detailed explanations about [how login.gov works](site.baseurl/policy/how-does-it-work/), [our privacy act statement](site.baseurl/policy/our-privacy-act-statement/), and [our security practices](site.baseurl/policy/our-security-practices/).

        url: "/policy/how-does-it-work/"
      content: |-
        ## How does it work ## {#how-does-it-work}

        Login.gov encrypts your personal information in transit and at rest and asks you before sharing your data with a partner agency. In order to reuse identity assurance credentials across government websites login.gov conforms to the NIST 800-63-3A specification.

        During identity proofing, the ID is also checked for authenticity. Then, the personal information is validated with the issuing source (ex: state DMVs) or authoritative sources (ex: credit, financial, telephone records). These external services do not retain any personal information, they are only used for validation purposes. Given these stringent requirements, login.gov currently supports state IDs and federal government employee IDs. Over time, login.gov will support additional IDs.

        Your address is also validated during this process. This can be done remotely using a telephone number associated with the address or through a letter with an enrollment code sent to the account holder's address. Please note, the enrollment code is valid for 30 days. (5-10 days for the letter to be delivered along with 10 days to complete address validation on [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov){:target="_blank"}). Once validated, login.gov identity credentials are encrypted with the account holder's password. Encryption ensures that only you, the account holder, can access your information with your password.

        Protecting your privacy through encryption does come at a cost. Login.gov operators, such as our Contact Center team, cannot make changes on your behalf like unlocking your account, changing your password or updating your email address or phone number. We encourage you to safeguard your authentication method for this reason. While this means login.gov cannot provide that level of customer support, if we chose to make these options available to our customer support team, it would make our system more vulnerable to hacking and other bad actors.

        The information you give login.gov will be shared with the applicable partner agency to provide access to information about you held by that agency as described in the associated systems of records notices. Please note that the login.gov system will record certain session-level information about your use of the service, including but not limited to, web browser type and version, and the length of your session. This information allows login.gov to better understand how the site is being used and how it can be made more helpful.

        ## Our privacy act statement ## {#our-privacy-act-statement}

        ### The Authority - Who authorizes the collection of this data?  ### {#authority}

        The information you provide is collected pursuant to 6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E), the E-Government Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–347, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note), and 40 USC § 501.

        ### The Purpose - Why do we need your information? ### {#purpose}

        Login.gov partners with agencies that need secure and private access to their applications and services. Each agency may request different levels of security depending on their needs. When you create and sign in to a login.gov account, you’re provided with an electronic identity assurance credential. We need your personally identifying information, or PII, to generate that credential. Imagine this credential like a key that only you can use. The key securely opens the door to a partner agency’s service or application.

        #### What information do we need? ####

        * For authentication to establish a secure account, we need your name, email address, and an authentication method. Your authentication method could be a phone number where we share a SMS code, USB Security Key or other options.
        * Identity proofing requires more sensitive information such as a social security number, address, phone number connected to your address, and U.S. based state ID or driver’s license.

        ### Routine Uses - With whom is the information routinely shared? ### {#routine-uses}

        * To third party identity proofing services, as necessary to identity proof an individual for access to a service at the required level of assurance.
        * To an expert, consultant, or contractor of GSA in the performance of a Federal duty to which the information is relevant.
        * To the Government Publishing Office (GPO), when Login.gov needs to mail a user an address confirmation form or if a user requests mailed notifications of account changes or of proofing attempts.

        This list is not comprehensive. Please see the system of records notice for all entities and individuals.

        #### What happens to the information you share? ####

        All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number on [your account page](https://secure.login.gov/account){:target="_blank"}.

        Your email address and phone number will be maintained for at least six years in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) guidance. However, GSA is authorized to maintain the information for longer if it is required for business use. Login.gov must be able to provide users access to information and services at partner agencies and therefore may have a business need to retain the information longer than the six-year retention period.

        There may be circumstances where we are required to share certain data. For example: if the information is relevant and necessary for an authorized law enforcement purpose; in order to respond to a breach; or to assist another agency as it responds to a breach. For additional information, see the system of record notice number GSA/TTS-1 that GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) published on [August 10, 2017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/10/2017-16852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}.

        Even when we share the information with law enforcement, we cannot access PII because the information is encrypted in a manner that is unretrievable to the login.gov team.

        ### Consent - How can you control what information is shared? ### {#consent}

        You decide what information to give us and can revoke consent at any time. Sharing your information is voluntary.

        However, failure to provide complete and accurate information may delay access to the partner agency. Login.gov does not make any eligibility or suitability determinations; that is the responsibility of the government websites that use the login.gov service.

        We will never share your information without your consent. Your data is encrypted and the only way to share it with a partner agency is if you, the authorized user, enter your password and explicitly grant consent to share the information.

        When you create an account or visit a new partner agency website after you have created your account, you will see the option to consent to share your information with the partner agency. You are required to give consent yearly for each agency.

        Remember you can revoke consent at any time through [your account page](https://secure.login.gov/account){:target="_blank"} or delete your account entirely on the same page.

        ### Records - Where can you find more information? ### {#records}

        Please see the Login.gov system of records notice (GSA/TTS–1) at [www.gsa.gov/SORN](https://www.gsa.gov/SORN){:target="_blank"}.

        ### Website Analytics ### {#analytics}

        Other data, like the pages you visit and the length of your session, are aggregated into reports to help us better understand how the site is being used and how we can make it more helpful. The data is anonymized. No personally identifying user information is tied to this data and it is only shared anonymously with the login.gov team.

        ## Our security practices ## {#our-security-practices}

        login.gov uses a variety of authentication methods to protect this U.S. government service and your data, and to ensure the service remains available to all users. These methods include monitoring and recording network traffic (any data going in and out of login.gov) to identify unauthorized attempts to change information, or otherwise cause damage.

        Unauthorized access or use of login.gov (e.g. use for criminal purposes, or to cause damage, etc.) is against the law, and may subject you to criminal prosecution and penalties.

        ### Vulnerability disclosure policy ### {#vdp}

        login.gov authorizes the outside security community to perform security research for the intent of reporting discovered security vulnerabilities in the login.gov platform.

    Solving real problems for potential users should be the focus for any system, and is doubly important when building an identity management system. Throughout this playbook, you’ll see how satisfying user needs is a guiding principle in every decision made.

    One of the first steps you should take is identifying your core users. For login.gov, we’ve identified two groups as our core users: the general public and tech people inside government agencies. The goal for the system itself is to support and address the needs of the general public. To put it plainly, we want to make sure that our system makes people comfortable with logging in to government services. The public needs to feel confident that login.gov behaves as expected and will not disappoint them. The system also needs to address users’ entire experience as they try to accomplish their goals. Because identity verification and authentication is technologically complex, it’s not unlikely that even the most tech-savvy people could get stuck if their phone is lost or a system has errors. So in support of each agency’s mission, architects and designers of consumer identity management systems need to anticipate likely sticking points so that people don’t lose access to the services and benefits.

    Agencies should figure out what portion of the public they serve and how services can be built to address their needs specifically. This will help agency integration teams understand what they need if they decide to implement the login.gov platform or any other consumer identity management system.

    Finally, you should continuously test designs and tools as they’re ready to share and then adjust your project based on what you learn. In some cases, we learn that the current best practices aren’t good enough. And in those cases we’re pushed to try out new ways to give the users the best experience possible. That process involves further testing, educating users, and a willingness to iterate.

    There are a number of specific design methods we practice to remain user-centered, and you can read about all of them, and use them yourself, by reviewing the [18F Design Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}.

    [Working transparently](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13){:target="_blank"} and creating a transparent system should be the way any agency works when building or implementing an identity management system. To execute this principle with login.gov, we’re building the platform so that interested parties can advise us on best practices and so that we remain accountable to the public and to our partners across the government. Further, it means building a system that tells users what it does with their information to create accountability and build trust. We’re engaging users and other interested parties through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp){:target="_blank"} and working on creating public forums where people can discuss our work.

    To make an identity management system transparent for end users, the system you build should include features that educate people about how the system works, why it works that way, and how they can control what’s happening with their data. You should also let users know what information is needed by an agency when logging in to a service. It’s also important to tell users what information your systems will store and if any data is shared with other agencies. If people using the system aren’t comfortable with information sharing, they shouldn’t be forced to participate.

    login.gov is working to implement all of these transparency-enhancing features. Further, to help people understand all that is happening, we’re creating a privacy policy that explains how data is shared and what it means to opt out.
  p_3: |-
    Technology and standards for identity verification and authentication can change rapidly. Consumer identity management systems should readily adapt to changing standards and react to new security threats. To make adapting to new policies and capabilities possible, it’s a good practice to build products using agile methods and with changing versions in mind. In other words, plan for modifications to help your identity service be as up-to-date as possible and compliant with current standards and policies.

    We’re embracing this principle for every aspect of the project in building login.gov.

    [Read this guide](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/index.html){:target="_blank"} to agile principles and practices put together by the 18F team to learn more about what it means to work in an agile way.
  p_4: |-
    Consumer identity management systems store personal information about users so that people don’t have to repeat the verification and authentication processes over and over again. However, collecting and storing personal information raises ethical and legal questions that system designers and developers need to consider. Often, what comes to mind first are technical questions about security: protecting information from unauthorized or illegal access and uses. However, we also need to worry about authorized, legal uses of personal information that violate users’ expectations of privacy. Users of login.gov need to be sure that we’re handling their personal information respectfully and appropriately.

    The first step is only collecting the information you absolutely need. And that’s what login.gov is doing. High-assurance identity verification for sensitive tasks does require extensive information collection. However, many activities don’t require high levels of assurance (LOA) and login.gov supports different LOA so agencies can clearly delineate their users who need lower levels of security from those with more sensitive needs while ensuring usability and data security. Minimizing the amount of information collected and stored not only lowers the security risk; it also reduces worries about re-use and disclosure for users.

    The next step is to give users as much control as possible over what information is shared. We believe firmly that people own their data, not us, and we will always act accordingly. If people aren’t comfortable with the data requirements for using a system, they should know they don’t have to sign up, and that there are other ways to accomplish their goals.

    As we design login.gov, we’re also working to educate users to help them safeguard their own data. We want people to understand why we have to ask for certain kinds of sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and how we’re using them.
  p_5: |-
    Figuring out who is trying to access personal information and making sure only authorized users can gain access to that information are the keys to consumer identity management. The reason systems like this exist is to secure the user’s identity from those looking to commit theft or fraud.

    Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.

    In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.

    In building login.gov, we’re adhering to standards put forward by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/){:target="_blank"} (NIST 800-63-3). Additionally we’re adhering to [government security best practices](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11){:target="_blank"} including FedRAMP, building in the open, conducting rigorous and routine security evaluations in addition to compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

  intro: When you’re ready to create your secure login.gov account, you’ll need to provide a few pieces of information&#58;
  step_1: |-
    ## 1. Email address
      * We recommend a personal email address that you’ll always be able to access rather than a work email address.
      * If you already have an account with login.gov with that email address, we’ll send you an email to let you know how you can reset your password and access the account.
  step_2: |-
    ## 2. Secure password
      * Passwords must be at least 12 characters, but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even enter spaces in between words to get to 12 characters.
  step_3: |-
    ## 3. One or more [authentication methods](site.baseurl/help/authentication-methods/which-authentication-method-should-i-use/) such as:
      * __More secure__
        * Security Key
        * Authentication application
        * Federal government employee or military identification (PIV/CAC)
      * __Less secure__
        * SMS/Text messages
        * Backup codes
  info: Depending on the security needs of the agency, you may need to prove your identity using a social security number, address, and/or U.S. based state-issued identification.

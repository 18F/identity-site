  intro:
    heading: Simple, secure access to government services online
    content: |
      login.gov offers the public secure and private online access to participating government programs. With one login.gov account, users can sign in to multiple government agencies. Our goal is to make managing federal benefits, services and applications easier and more secure.
  column_1:
    heading: Simple *and* secure for the public
    content:
      p_1: Because login.gov is a shared service,
      li_1: Users need fewer passwords and learn fewer interfaces.
      li_2: Security experts protect one service instead of many.
      li_3: Dedicated teams of design and security experts will continuously improve it.
  column_2:
    heading: Saving time and <br class="sm-show" />money
    p_1: |
      login.gov handles software development, security operations, and customer support. This frees up government departments to focus on their missions while reducing costs and improving security.

      A shared authentication platform frees up agency resources to deliver great services while reducing costs and improving security.
  column_3:
    heading: Built <br class="sm-show"/>cooperatively
    p_1: |
      login.gov works hand-in-hand with the private sector and nonprofits to identify and implement best practices and new standards in secure, privacy-protecting authentication.

        Led by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov){:target="_blank"} and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov){:target="_blank"}, login.gov builds on groundwork laid by the [National Institute for Standards in Technology](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"}, the [Cybersecurity National Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan){:target="_blank"}, and the [Federal Acquisition Service](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105080){:target="_blank"}.

      Your privacy is very important to us. We’re providing you with
      our privacy policy so you are aware of what information we collect,
      why we collect it, and what we do with it. login.gov does not collect
      your email address or phone number unless you choose to provide it.
      We do collect other limited information automatically from visitors
      who read or browse information from our site. We do this to better
      understand how the site is being used and how we can make it more
      helpful.
    p_2: |
      If you create an account, login.gov collects personally identifiable
      information (PII) from you, including your email address and phone
      number. We collect your email address and with your consent share it
      with each federal agency (“partner agency”) at which you are seeking
      to access information and services. We collect your phone number in
      order to enable two-factor authentication as a security measure for
      your login.gov account. Your phone number is only sent to a one-time
      password service provider, not any of the partner agencies.

  heading: How login.gov keeps personal information private
  content:
    p_1: |
      login.gov encrypts the personal information of each user separately,
      using a unique value generated from each user’s password. Our
      encryption method works like a safe deposit box in a bank vault.
      Only the user has the key. Only the user can open the box to reveal
      the contents. Only the user knows the password, and only the user can
      decrypt their information.
  column_1:
    heading: The vault
    p_1: |
      It's hard to break into the “vault” or database. login.gov implements the latest [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"} standards for secure authentication and verification. Our plans for ongoing security include regular penetration testing and external security reviews.
  column_2:
    heading: The safe deposit box
    p_1: |
      Individual accounts get a double layer of security. We require
      two-factor authentication as well as strong passwords that meet
      new NIST requirements. Two factor authentication requires that
      you login with your password and a code that we send to your phone.
    p_2: |
      We will evaluate and implement new authentication methods as they
      become widely available to make sure that login.gov remains
      accessible and secure.
  column_3:
    heading: Your personal key
    p_1: |
      Encrypting personal data separately means that login.gov cannot
      share any information with other government entities without
      users’ permission. Not even database administrators can decrypt
      a user’s personal information without the user’s password.

  heading: Implementing an identity management system
  section_1:
    ul:
      li_1:
        a_1: What are you protecting?
      li_2:
        a_1: What is a consumer identity management system?

      li_4:
        a_1: Resources
  section_2:
    heading_1: What are you protecting?
    p_1: It’s worth assessing what you really need before beginning implementation. Not all information requires an identity system to manage access. You can protect the privacy of users and reduce the security risk to your systems by avoiding any unnecessary collection of personally identifiable information — this even includes contact details.
    heading_2: "You might not need to implement an identity system if:"
    ul_1:
      li_1: You do not need to have an ongoing relationship with users.
      li_2: Transactions don’t depend upon personal information being accurate.
      li_3: You can rely on other forms of security.
    heading_3: To answer this, ask
    ul_2:
      li_1:
        content: What transactions will users need?
        p_1: Will the transactions be ongoing, as when users bookmark benefits or grant applications to fill out later, then return repeatedly to check the application status? Or will they be a one-time or infrequent, as when people download medical or financial records?
      li_2:
        content: What kind of information do you need to protect your customers?
        p_1: Do you need full name and other personal information so that users can access private information? Or do you only need to verify that a user fits in certain categories, such as the veterans category or the senior citizens category?
      li_3:
        content: What sort of crime might access to this information make possible?
        p_1: Information that seems innocent on its own might still be valuable to fraudsters and other criminals in combination with other easily accessed information.
      li_4:
        content: What other means of security are available?
        p_1: Postal tracking numbers, for example, are not secrets because the package will only be delivered to a specific address. The safety of the delivery rests on the security of the building and the conduct of the delivery person, not on the secrecy of the number itself.
    heading_4: What kinds of resources do you already have to identify customers?
    p_2: Your agency may already have mission-specific information and resources that can be used to identify customers. By integrating resources you know and trust, you can increase the reliability of identification.
    heading_5: To answer this, ask
    ul_3:
      li_1:
        content: What resources are unique to your agency?
        p_1: Individuals’ confidential interactions with government agencies can generate a trail of metadata. Used carefully, that metadata can facilitate identity verification based on knowledge of those activities. Other government organizations serve as authoritative repositories of biometric data available for internal use. Some agencies may have physical locations that customers can visit.
    heading_6: What is a consumer identity management system?
    p_3: When you’re at home and someone knocks at your door it’s easy enough to decide whether or not to answer. Based on your knowledge of who’s outside, you can decide whether to open the door. Is the person outside a friend? A mail carrier or other expected service provider? A complete stranger? Online, the question of deciding “who’s there” is much harder. Consumer identity management systems make it easier for system administrators to decide whether or not to open the door, and how wide.
    heading_7: What is an identity?
    p_4: In the world of security, “identity” has a very specific technical meaning that differs from a plain English sense. An “identity” in technical terms is a special kind of record — a bundle of different types of data that together describes only one system user [NIST 800-63-3]. That data can include references to official government records, such as driver’s license numbers and registered birth dates, as well as more mutable data such as email addresses and usernames. Physical attributes such as fingerprints and DNA can also be part of an identity record.
    heading_8: How does identity and access management work?
    p_5: System administrators assign access privileges to each identity record. These privileges authorize certain activities and forbid others. To “open the door” safely, however, administrators need confidence that the users knocking at the door are who they say they are.
    p_6: To give the system and its administrators confidence in their identities, users need to prove their identities through an activity called authentication. Users authenticate themselves by presenting evidence linking themselves to records. To do that, users first help the system validate their record — for example, by typing in a username. Then users hand over the evidence — often, passwords or other information only the real person would know.
    heading_9: What does having an identity record enable?
    p_7: "Identity systems don’t just benefit system administrators. Users can do some very handy things with an authenticated digital identity. Here’s a small list:"
    ul_4:
      li_1:
        span_1: Pre-filling online forms with verified information speeds up application processing.
        span_2: There’s less redundant effort, and users don’t need to worry about basic errors.
      li_2:
        span_1: Authenticated users can access and download data the system holds about them, such as account activity.
        span_2: With a verified legal identity, the user can access very sensitive medical or financial records and even download them.
      li_3:
        span_1: Identity systems can protect your privacy.
        span_2: If you need to be 21 or older to access a service, you can authorize an identity system to confirm your age without sharing your exact birth date.

    heading_2: Implementation
    p_3: Before implementing login.gov or any other consumer identity management system, you should determine whether your agency or organization needs one. Below is a list of questions to ask and things to consider to help you figure that out.
    p_4:
      a_1: Learn about implementation
principles_page:
  heading_1: The principles of the identity playbook
  heading_2: Focus on user needs
  ul_1:
    li_1: Identify your potential audiences
    li_2: Understand the login experiences and identity needs of your audiences
    li_3: Conduct research before building or implementing a system
    li_4: Test your product to identify blind spots or areas for improvement
    li_5: When the current best practices aren’t good enough for your users, test new solutions and help guide adoption
  p_1: |
    Solving real problems for potential users should be the focus for any system, and is doubly important when building an identity management system. Throughout this playbook, you’ll see how satisfying user needs is a guiding principle in every decision made.

    One of the first steps you should take is identifying your core users. For login.gov, we’ve identified two groups as our core users: the general public and tech people inside government agencies. The goal for the system itself is to support and address the needs of the general public. To put it plainly, we want to make sure that our system makes people comfortable with logging in to government services. The public needs to feel confident that login.gov behaves as expected and will not disappoint them. The system also needs to address users’ entire experience as they try to accomplish their goals. Because identity verification and authentication is technologically complex, it’s not unlikely that even the most tech-savvy people could get stuck if their phone is lost or a system has errors. So in support of each agency’s mission, architects and designers of consumer identity management systems need to anticipate likely sticking points so that people don’t lose access to the services and benefits.

    Agencies should figure out what portion of the public they serve and how services can be built to address their needs specifically. This will help agency integration teams understand what they need if they decide to implement the login.gov platform or any other consumer identity management system.

    Finally, you should continuously test designs and tools as they’re ready to share and then adjust your project based on what you learn. In some cases, we learn that the current best practices aren’t good enough. And in those cases we’re pushed to try out new ways to give the users the best experience possible. That process involves further testing, educating users, and a willingness to iterate.

    There are a number of specific design methods we practice to remain user-centered, and you can read about all of them, and use them yourself, by reviewing the [18F Design Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}.
  heading_3: Be transparent about how it works
  ul_2:
    li_1: Engage experts, advocates, and the public early and often
    li_2: Explain how and why you’re collecting, sharing, and storing data
    li_3: Create a privacy policy that regular people can access and understand
    li_4: Create a privacy policy that is inclusive and informative
  p_2: |
    [Working transparently](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13){:target="_blank"} and creating a transparent system should be the way any agency works when building or implementing an identity management system. To execute this principle with login.gov, we’re building the platform so that interested parties can advise us on best practices and so that we remain accountable to the public and to our partners across the government. Further, it means building a system that tells users what it does with their information to create accountability and build trust. We’re engaging users and other interested parties through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp){:target="_blank"} and working on creating public forums where people can discuss our work.

    To make an identity management system transparent for end users, the system you build should include features that educate people about how the system works, why it works that way, and how they can control what’s happening with their data. You should also let users know what information is needed by an agency when logging in to a service. It’s also important to tell users what information your systems will store and if any data is shared with other agencies. If people using the system aren’t comfortable with information sharing, they shouldn’t be forced to participate.

    login.gov is working to implement all of these transparency-enhancing features. Further, to help people understand all that is happening, we’re creating a privacy policy that explains how data is shared and what it means to opt out.
  heading_4: Build a flexible product
  ul_3:
    li_1: Develop the product in sprints and evaluate effectiveness after each sprint
    li_2: Continually talk with stakeholders and experts to evaluate needs and success metrics
    li_3: Test your product with users continuously as you add new features and refine old ones
    li_4: Define what a minimal viable product is for your identity management needs
    li_5: Plan to evolve based on changing technology and changing standards
  p_3: |
    Technology and standards for identity verification and authentication can change rapidly. Consumer identity management systems should readily adapt to changing standards and react to new security threats. To make adapting to new policies and capabilities possible, it’s a good practice to build products using agile methods and with changing versions in mind. In other words, plan for modifications to help your identity service be as up-to-date as possible and compliant with current standards and policies.

    We’re embracing this principle for every aspect of the project in building login.gov.

    [Read this guide](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/index.html){:target="_blank"} to agile principles and practices put together by the 18F team to learn more about what it means to work in an agile way.
  heading_5: Use modern privacy practices
  ul_4:
    li_1: Store as little personally identifying data as possible
    li_2: Give users other means of accomplishing their goals
    li_3: Give users control over their data
  p_4: |
    Consumer identity management systems store personal information about users so that people don’t have to repeat the verification and authentication processes over and over again. However, collecting and storing personal information raises ethical and legal questions that system designers and developers need to consider. Often, what comes to mind first are technical questions about security: protecting information from unauthorized or illegal access and uses. However, we also need to worry about authorized, legal uses of personal information that violate users’ expectations of privacy. Users of login.gov need to be sure that we’re handling their personal information respectfully and appropriately.

    The first step is only collecting the information you absolutely need. And that’s what login.gov is doing. High-assurance identity verification for sensitive tasks does require extensive information collection. However, many activities don’t require high levels of assurance (LOA) and login.gov supports different LOA so agencies can clearly delineate their users who need lower levels of security from those with more sensitive needs while ensuring usability and data security. Minimizing the amount of information collected and stored not only lowers the security risk; it also reduces worries about re-use and disclosure for users.

    The next step is to give users as much control as possible over what information is shared. We believe firmly that people own their data, not us, and we will always act accordingly. If people aren’t comfortable with the data requirements for using a system, they should know they don’t have to sign up, and that there are other ways to accomplish their goals.

    As we design login.gov, we’re also working to educate users to help them safeguard their own data. We want people to understand why we have to ask for certain kinds of sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and how we’re using them.
  heading_6: Create responsive security systems
  ul_5:
    li_1: Identify industry best practices and abide by them
    li_2: Comply with federal regulations such as FISMA and FedRamp
    li_3: Set up systems to monitor and detect fraud
    li_4: Use modern encryption techniques throughout the technology stack
    li_5: Only store the absolute minimum data necessary
    li_6: Help users understand the security measures they are required to carry out
  p_5: |
    Figuring out who is trying to access personal information and making sure only authorized users can gain access to that information are the keys to consumer identity management. The reason systems like this exist is to secure the user’s identity from those looking to commit theft or fraud.

    Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.

    In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.

    In building login.gov, we’re adhering to standards put forward by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/){:target="_blank"} (NIST 800-63-2) and will move adapt their new draft standards (NIST 800-63-3) as they become final. The draft standards take a very different approach to authentication and identity proofing (how a person logs in and how they verify their identity) from the current version. Additionally we’re adhering to [government security best practices](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11){:target="_blank"} including FedRAMP, building in the open, conducting rigorous and routine security evaluations in addition to compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

      This privacy notice describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect
      your personal information, as well as your obligation to disclose it.

      Our goal is to protect your personal information, and we will not share
      it without your permission. For example, we will encrypt your personal
      information in transit and at rest and ask you before sharing your data
      with a partner agency. However, there may be circumstances where we are
      required to share certain data. For example: if the information is relevant
      and necessary for an authorized law enforcement purpose; in order to
      respond to a breach; or to assist another agency as it responds to a
      breach. For additional information, see the [system of record notice number GSA/TTS-1](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01174/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-new-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}
      that GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) published on January 19, 2017.

      ### Privacy Act statement

      #### Authorities

      The information you provide to access your login.gov account is
      collected pursuant to 6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E), the [E-Government Act of 2002 (44 USC § 3501)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ347/html/PLAW-107publ347.htm){:target="_blank"},
      and 40 USC § 501.

      #### Purpose

      The information that you submit is used to create or update your
      login.gov account. Once you create an account, with
      your consent, login.gov will share your email address with the partner agency to
      provide online access to government information and services.

      #### Disclosure

      You decide what information to give us. However, failure to provide
      complete and accurate information may delay access to the partner agency.
      The information you give login.gov will be shared with the applicable
      federal agency to provide access to information about you held by that
      agency as described in the associated [systems of records notices](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01174/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-new-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}.
      Please note that the login.gov system will record certain session-level information
      about your use of the service, including but not limited to, web browser
      type and version, and the length of your session. This information allows
      login.gov better understand how the site is being used and how it can be
      made more helpful.

      #### Storage

      All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s
      [Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"}.
      You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number
      by accessing it in your account. You should choose an email address
      through which you would like to receive correspondence from any partner
      agency whose services or information you might access. Changing that
      address will redirect all email correspondence with any partner agency.

      Similarly, you should choose the number of a phone that you have access
      to in order to receive and respond with the one-time password(s) that
      are sent to that number.

      Your email address and phone number will be maintained for at least six
      years in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration
      (NARA) guidance. However, GSA is authorized to maintain the information
      for longer if it is required for business use. login.gov must be able
      to provide users access to information and services at partner agencies
      and therefore may have a business need to retain the information longer
      than the six-year retention period.

  - section: Our security practices
    anchor: "our-security-practices"
    content: |
      login.gov uses a variety of security methods to protect this U.S.
      government service and your data, and to ensure the service remains
      available to all users. These methods include monitoring and recording
      network traffic (any data going in and out of login.gov) to identify
      unauthorized attempts to change information, or otherwise cause damage.

      Unauthorized access or use of login.gov (e.g. use for criminal purposes,
      or to cause damage, etc) is against the law, and may subject you to
      criminal prosecution and penalties.

      ### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

      login.gov authorizes the outside security community to perform security
      research for the intent of reporting discovered security vulnerabilities
      in the login.gov platform.

      View our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/){:target="_blank"}
      for details on this policy and how to report discovered vulnerabilities.

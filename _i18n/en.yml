    heading: Simple, secure access to government services online
    content: login.gov offers the public secure and private online access to participating
      government programs. With one login.gov account, users can sign in to multiple
      government agencies. Our goal is to make managing federal benefits, services
      and applications easier and more secure.
  column_1:
    heading: Simple and secure for the public
    p_1: Because login.gov is a shared service, users need fewer passwords and learn
      fewer interfaces. Also, security experts protect one service instead of many.
      Dedicated teams of design and security experts also will continuously improve
      it.
  column_2:
    heading: Saving time and <br class="sm-show" />money
    p_1: login.gov handles software development, security operations, and customer
      support. This frees up government departments to focus on their missions while
      reducing costs and improving security.

      Your privacy is very important to us. We’re providing you with
      our privacy policy so you are aware of what information we collect,
      why we collect it, and what we do with it. login.gov does not collect
      your email address or phone number unless you choose to provide it.
      We do collect other limited information automatically from visitors
      who read or browse information from our site. We do this to better
      understand how the site is being used and how we can make it more
      helpful.

      If you create an account, login.gov collects personally identifiable
      information (PII) from you, including your email address and phone
      number. We collect your email address and with your consent share it
      with each federal agency (“partner agency”) at which you are seeking
      to access information and services. We collect your phone number in
      order to enable two-factor authentication as a security measure for
      your login.gov account. Your phone number is only sent to a one-time

  heading: How login.gov keeps personal information private
  content:
    p_1: |-
      login.gov encrypts the sensitive personal information of each user
      separately using a unique value generated from each user’s password. 
      Our encryption method works like a safe deposit box in a bank vault.
      Only the user has the key. Only the user can open the box to reveal
      the contents. Only the user knows the password, and only the user can
      decrypt their information.
  column_1:
    heading: The vault
    p_1: It's hard to break into the “vault” or database. login.gov implements the
      latest [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"}
      standards for secure authentication and verification. Our plans for ongoing
      security include regular penetration testing and external security reviews.
  column_2:
    heading: The safe deposit box
    p_1: |-
      Individual accounts get a double layer of security. We require
      two-factor authentication as well as strong passwords that meet
      new NIST requirements. two-factor authentication requires that
      you login with your password and a code that we send to your phone.
    p_2: |-
      We will evaluate and implement new authentication methods as they
      become widely available to make sure that login.gov remains
      accessible and secure.
  column_3:
    heading: Your personal key
    p_1: |-
      Encrypting personal data separately means that login.gov cannot
      share any sensitive information with other government entities without
      users’ permission. Not even database administrators can decrypt
      a user’s personal information without the user’s password.

  section_2:
    heading_1: What are you protecting?
    p_1: It’s worth assessing what you really need before beginning implementation.
      Not all information requires an identity system to manage access. You can protect
      the privacy of users and reduce the security risk to your systems by avoiding
      any unnecessary collection of personally identifiable information — this even
      includes contact details.
    heading_2: 'You might not need to implement an identity system if:'
    ul_1:
      li_1: You do not need to have an ongoing relationship with users.
      li_2: Transactions don’t depend upon personal information being accurate.
      li_3: You can rely on other forms of security.
    heading_3: To answer this, ask
    ul_2:
      li_1:
        content: What transactions will users need?
        p_1: Will the transactions be ongoing, as when users bookmark benefits or
          grant applications to fill out later, then return repeatedly to check the
          application status? Or will they be a one-time or infrequent, as when people
          download medical or financial records?
      li_2:
        content: What kind of information do you need to protect your customers?
        p_1: Do you need full name and other personal information so that users can
          access private information? Or do you only need to verify that a user fits
          in certain categories, such as the veterans category or the senior citizens
          category?
      li_3:
        content: What sort of crime might access to this information make possible?
        p_1: Information that seems innocent on its own might still be valuable to
          fraudsters and other criminals in combination with other easily accessed
          information.
      li_4:
        content: What other means of security are available?
        p_1: Postal tracking numbers, for example, are not secrets because the package
          will only be delivered to a specific address. The safety of the delivery
          rests on the security of the building and the conduct of the delivery person,
          not on the secrecy of the number itself.
    heading_4: What kinds of resources do you already have to identify customers?
    p_2: Your agency may already have mission-specific information and resources that
      can be used to identify customers. By integrating resources you know and trust,
      you can increase the reliability of identification.
    heading_5: To answer this, ask
    ul_3:
      li_1:
        content: What resources are unique to your agency?
        p_1: Individuals’ confidential interactions with government agencies can generate
          a trail of metadata. Used carefully, that metadata can facilitate identity
          verification based on knowledge of those activities. Other government organizations
          serve as authoritative repositories of biometric data available for internal
          use. Some agencies may have physical locations that customers can visit.
    heading_6: What is a consumer identity management system?
    p_3: When you’re at home and someone knocks at your door it’s easy enough to decide
      whether or not to answer. Based on your knowledge of who’s outside, you can
      decide whether to open the door. Is the person outside a friend? A mail carrier
      or other expected service provider? A complete stranger? Online, the question
      of deciding “who’s there” is much harder. Consumer identity management systems
      make it easier for system administrators to decide whether or not to open the
      door, and how wide.
    heading_7: What is an identity?
    p_4: In the world of security, “identity” has a very specific technical meaning
      that differs from a plain English sense. An “identity” in technical terms is
      a special kind of record — a bundle of different types of data that together
      describes only one system user [NIST 800-63-3]. That data can include references
      to official government records, such as driver’s license numbers and registered
      birth dates, as well as more mutable data such as email addresses and usernames.
      Physical attributes such as fingerprints and DNA can also be part of an identity
      record.
    heading_8: How does identity and access management work?
    p_5: System administrators assign access privileges to each identity record. These
      privileges authorize certain activities and forbid others. To “open the door”
      safely, however, administrators need confidence that the users knocking at the
      door are who they say they are.
    p_6: To give the system and its administrators confidence in their identities,
      users need to prove their identities through an activity called authentication.
      Users authenticate themselves by presenting evidence linking themselves to records.
      To do that, users first help the system validate their record — for example,
      by typing in a username. Then users hand over the evidence — often, passwords
      or other information only the real person would know.
    heading_9: What does having an identity record enable?
    p_7: 'Identity systems don’t just benefit system administrators. Users can do
      some very handy things with an authenticated digital identity. Here’s a small
      list:'
    ul_4:
      li_1:
        span_1: Pre-filling online forms with verified information speeds up application
          processing.
        span_2: There’s less redundant effort, and users don’t need to worry about
          basic errors.
      li_2:
        span_1: Authenticated users can access and download data the system holds
          about them, such as account activity.
        span_2: With a verified legal identity, the user can access very sensitive
          medical or financial records and even download them.
      li_3:
        span_1: Identity systems can protect your privacy.
        span_2: If you need to be 21 or older to access a service, you can authorize
          an identity system to confirm your age without sharing your exact birth
          date.

    heading_2: Implementation
    p_3: Before implementing login.gov or any other consumer identity management system,
      you should determine whether your agency or organization needs one. Below is

    li_4: Test your product to identify blind spots or areas for improvement
    li_5: When the current best practices aren’t good enough for your users, test
      new solutions and help guide adoption
  p_1: |-
    Solving real problems for potential users should be the focus for any system, and is doubly important when building an identity management system. Throughout this playbook, you’ll see how satisfying user needs is a guiding principle in every decision made.

    One of the first steps you should take is identifying your core users. For login.gov, we’ve identified two groups as our core users: the general public and tech people inside government agencies. The goal for the system itself is to support and address the needs of the general public. To put it plainly, we want to make sure that our system makes people comfortable with logging in to government services. The public needs to feel confident that login.gov behaves as expected and will not disappoint them. The system also needs to address users’ entire experience as they try to accomplish their goals. Because identity verification and authentication is technologically complex, it’s not unlikely that even the most tech-savvy people could get stuck if their phone is lost or a system has errors. So in support of each agency’s mission, architects and designers of consumer identity management systems need to anticipate likely sticking points so that people don’t lose access to the services and benefits.

    Agencies should figure out what portion of the public they serve and how services can be built to address their needs specifically. This will help agency integration teams understand what they need if they decide to implement the login.gov platform or any other consumer identity management system.

    Finally, you should continuously test designs and tools as they’re ready to share and then adjust your project based on what you learn. In some cases, we learn that the current best practices aren’t good enough. And in those cases we’re pushed to try out new ways to give the users the best experience possible. That process involves further testing, educating users, and a willingness to iterate.

    There are a number of specific design methods we practice to remain user-centered, and you can read about all of them, and use them yourself, by reviewing the [18F Design Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}.
  heading_3: Be transparent about how it works
  ul_2:
    li_1: Engage experts, advocates, and the public early and often
    li_2: Explain how and why you’re collecting, sharing, and storing data
    li_3: Create a privacy policy that regular people can access and understand
    li_4: Create a privacy policy that is inclusive and informative
  p_2: |-
    [Working transparently](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13){:target="_blank"} and creating a transparent system should be the way any agency works when building or implementing an identity management system. To execute this principle with login.gov, we’re building the platform so that interested parties can advise us on best practices and so that we remain accountable to the public and to our partners across the government. Further, it means building a system that tells users what it does with their information to create accountability and build trust. We’re engaging users and other interested parties through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp){:target="_blank"} and working on creating public forums where people can discuss our work.

    To make an identity management system transparent for end users, the system you build should include features that educate people about how the system works, why it works that way, and how they can control what’s happening with their data. You should also let users know what information is needed by an agency when logging in to a service. It’s also important to tell users what information your systems will store and if any data is shared with other agencies. If people using the system aren’t comfortable with information sharing, they shouldn’t be forced to participate.

    login.gov is working to implement all of these transparency-enhancing features. Further, to help people understand all that is happening, we’re creating a privacy policy that explains how data is shared and what it means to opt out.
  heading_4: Build a flexible product
  ul_3:
    li_1: Develop the product in sprints and evaluate effectiveness after each sprint
    li_2: Continually talk with stakeholders and experts to evaluate needs and success
      metrics

      old ones
    li_4: Define what a minimal viable product is for your identity management needs
    li_5: Plan to evolve based on changing technology and changing standards
  p_3: |-
    Technology and standards for identity verification and authentication can change rapidly. Consumer identity management systems should readily adapt to changing standards and react to new security threats. To make adapting to new policies and capabilities possible, it’s a good practice to build products using agile methods and with changing versions in mind. In other words, plan for modifications to help your identity service be as up-to-date as possible and compliant with current standards and policies.

    We’re embracing this principle for every aspect of the project in building login.gov.

    [Read this guide](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/index.html){:target="_blank"} to agile principles and practices put together by the 18F team to learn more about what it means to work in an agile way.
  heading_5: Use modern privacy practices
  ul_4:
    li_1: Store as little personally identifying data as possible
    li_2: Give users other means of accomplishing their goals
    li_3: Give users control over their data
  p_4: |-
    Consumer identity management systems store personal information about users so that people don’t have to repeat the verification and authentication processes over and over again. However, collecting and storing personal information raises ethical and legal questions that system designers and developers need to consider. Often, what comes to mind first are technical questions about security: protecting information from unauthorized or illegal access and uses. However, we also need to worry about authorized, legal uses of personal information that violate users’ expectations of privacy. Users of login.gov need to be sure that we’re handling their personal information respectfully and appropriately.

    The first step is only collecting the information you absolutely need. And that’s what login.gov is doing. High-assurance identity verification for sensitive tasks does require extensive information collection. However, many activities don’t require high levels of assurance (LOA) and login.gov supports different LOA so agencies can clearly delineate their users who need lower levels of security from those with more sensitive needs while ensuring usability and data security. Minimizing the amount of information collected and stored not only lowers the security risk; it also reduces worries about re-use and disclosure for users.

    The next step is to give users as much control as possible over what information is shared. We believe firmly that people own their data, not us, and we will always act accordingly. If people aren’t comfortable with the data requirements for using a system, they should know they don’t have to sign up, and that there are other ways to accomplish their goals.

    As we design login.gov, we’re also working to educate users to help them safeguard their own data. We want people to understand why we have to ask for certain kinds of sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and how we’re using them.
  heading_6: Create responsive security systems
  ul_5:
    li_1: Identify industry best practices and abide by them
    li_2: Comply with federal regulations such as FISMA and FedRamp
    li_3: Set up systems to monitor and detect fraud
    li_4: Use modern encryption techniques throughout the technology stack
    li_5: Only store the absolute minimum data necessary
    li_6: Help users understand the security measures they are required to carry out
  p_5: |-
    Figuring out who is trying to access personal information and making sure only authorized users can gain access to that information are the keys to consumer identity management. The reason systems like this exist is to secure the user’s identity from those looking to commit theft or fraud.

    Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.

    In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.

    In building login.gov, we’re adhering to standards put forward by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/){:target="_blank"} (NIST 800-63-2) and will move adapt their new draft standards (NIST 800-63-3) as they become final. The draft standards take a very different approach to authentication and identity proofing (how a person logs in and how they verify their identity) from the current version. Additionally we’re adhering to [government security best practices](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11){:target="_blank"} including FedRAMP, building in the open, conducting rigorous and routine security evaluations in addition to compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

    This privacy notice describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect
    your personal information, as well as your obligation to disclose it.

    Our goal is to protect your personal information, and we will not share
    it without your permission. For example, we will encrypt your personal
    information in transit and at rest and ask you before sharing your data
    with a partner agency. However, there may be circumstances where we are
    required to share certain data. For example: if the information is relevant
    and necessary for an authorized law enforcement purpose; in order to
    respond to a breach; or to assist another agency as it responds to a
    breach. For additional information, see the [system of record notice number GSA/TTS-1](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/10/2017-16852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}
    that GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) published on August 10, 2017.

    ### Privacy Act statement

    #### Authorities

    The information you provide to access your login.gov account is
    collected pursuant to 6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E), the [E-Government Act of 2002 (44 USC § 3501)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ347/html/PLAW-107publ347.htm){:target="_blank"},
    and 40 USC § 501.

    #### Purpose

    The information that you submit is used to create or update your
    login.gov account. Once you create an account, with
    your consent, login.gov will share your email address with the partner agency to
    provide online access to government information and services.

    #### Disclosure

    You decide what information to give us. However, failure to provide
    complete and accurate information may delay access to the partner agency.
    The information you give login.gov will be shared with the applicable
    federal agency to provide access to information about you held by that
    agency as described in the associated [systems of records notices](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/10/2017-16852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records){:target="_blank"}.
    Please note that the login.gov system will record certain session-level information
    about your use of the service, including but not limited to, web browser
    type and version, and the length of your session. This information allows
    login.gov better understand how the site is being used and how it can be
    made more helpful.

    #### Storage

    All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s
    [Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"}.
    You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number
    by accessing it in your account. You should choose an email address
    through which you would like to receive correspondence from any partner
    agency whose services or information you might access. Changing that
    address will redirect all email correspondence with any partner agency.

    Similarly, you should choose the number of a phone that you have access
    to in order to receive and respond with the one-time password(s) that
    are sent to that number.

    Your email address and phone number will be maintained for at least six
    years in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration
    (NARA) guidance. However, GSA is authorized to maintain the information
    for longer if it is required for business use. login.gov must be able
    to provide users access to information and services at partner agencies
    and therefore may have a business need to retain the information longer
    than the six-year retention period.

    ### Privacy Impact Assessment

    View our [Privacy Impact Assessment](site.baseurl/docs/privacy-impact-assessment.pdf).
- section: Our security practices
  anchor: our-security-practices
  content: |-
    login.gov uses a variety of security methods to protect this U.S.
    government service and your data, and to ensure the service remains
    available to all users. These methods include monitoring and recording
    network traffic (any data going in and out of login.gov) to identify
    unauthorized attempts to change information, or otherwise cause damage.

    Unauthorized access or use of login.gov (e.g. use for criminal purposes,
    or to cause damage, etc.) is against the law, and may subject you to
    criminal prosecution and penalties.

    ### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

    login.gov authorizes the outside security community to perform security
    research for the intent of reporting discovered security vulnerabilities
    in the login.gov platform.

Select “edit” next to the email address. Enter the new email address and submit it. Then check your email account and look for an email from login.gov. Open the email and select the link provided. selecting the link will redirect you back to login.gov. Once you reach login.gov, your new email address is established.
    how-do-i-change-my-password: |-
      To change your password, go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and select “Manage Account” to sign into your login.gov account. Select “Edit” next to password, enter the new password and submit your change. Passwords must be at least 9 characters but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 9 characters. Instead, try making a long and complex password by using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize. And please make it different than any other passwords you use to sign into other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same passwords for your email, financial and social media accounts makes identity theft easier.

      To change the phone number where you get your security code, go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and select “Manage Account” to sign into your login.gov account. Once signed in, select “edit” next to the phone number. Enter the phone number and select “confirm change.” login.gov will immediately send your security code to confirm the new phone number.

      If you cannot receive the security code because you no longer have access to your phone, you will need to [sign in using your personal key](site.basurl/help/signing-in/how-do-i-sign-in-if-i-dont-have-my-phone-or-my-phone-number-has-changed). 

    how-do-I-get-a-new-personal-key: |-
      To request a new personal key, go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and select “Manage Account” to sign into sign into your login.gov account page. Next to personal key select “Get a new key.” Follow the instructions to write down and/or print out the new personal key and select to continue. Remember, you can only request a new personal key if you are able to sign into your login.gov account. 

      Store your personal key in a safe place as this is the only way you can sign in if you can’t receive a security code. Some good ways of storing your personal key include writing it down, taking a screenshot, pasting it into a secure document, or making a printout of it. You can only use each personal key only once, after which we’ll give you another.
    
    how-do-I-set-up-an-authentication-app: |-
      If you don’t want to receive security codes by text or phone call, you can set up an authentication app on your device to generate security codes. 
        1. Choose a device, such as a computer or mobile device (phone or tablet), on which you can install apps. 
        2. Download and install one of the following authentication apps to your device:
          - Android options: [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, [Authy](https://authy.com){:target="_blank"}, [LastPass](https://lastpass.com){:target="_blank"}, [1Password](https://1password.com){:target="_blank"}

        3. Open a new browser and sign into your login.gov account at https://secure.login.gov/. *NOTE*: If you do not have access to the phone you used to create your account, you will need to sign in using your personal key.
        4. Select “enable” next to Authentication app and follow the instructions to scan or enter a code associating your authentication app with your account.

      You will now be able to use the one-time passcodes generated by the application each time you sign in instead of receiving a text message or a phone call. If you are having difficulty setting up the authentication app, you will need to contact the app developer directly for assistance.

    do-i-need-a-mobile-phone-to-use-logingov: |-
      login.gov requires all users to use two-factor authentication when creating an account and signing in. You can receive security codes using a mobile phone or landline. Mobile phones can receive security codes by text message or phone call. Landlines can receive security codes only by a phone call. login.gov cannot send security codes to extensions. 
 
      If you do not have a phone, you can also set up your account using an authentication application on the device you are using to sign in. Once you have created your account, you can also use your personal key to sign in.

    how-do-i-create-an-account-with-logingov: |-
      #### How do you create an account with login.gov?
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/1-login-gov-welcome.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Login.gov create account page help image" />
      To create a login.gov account you’ll need a valid email address and a working phone number. We’ll also ask you to create a password.

      Please be prepared to save your password as well as the personal key that is generated for you in case you ever need to recover your account.

      #### Enter your email and confirm it
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/2-login-gov-enteremail.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Enter your email help image" />
      Select [“create an account”](https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email) and enter your email address. Then check your email account for a message from us. Within the email is a link. selecting the link will confirm your email address and send you back to login.gov.
      This is what it looks like:
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/3-confirm-your-email.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Confirm your email help image" />

      #### Create a password
      Next, you will create a strong password. Use the password strength meter on the screen as a guide. Passwords must be at least 9 characters, but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even enter spaces in between words to get to 9 characters.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/4-choose-a-password.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Choose password help image" />

      #### Enter your phone number and confirm it
      Next, you will enter a phone number at which you can get phone calls or text messages. If you have a landline, you must receive your security code by phone call. login.gov cannot send security codes to extensions.  
      
      We will send a unique security code to that phone number each time you sign into your account. This is called two-factor authentication. The second step keeps your account more secure than using only a password. You can also use an authentication app on your phone or your browser. [Read more on how to set up an authentication app.](site.baseurl/help/changing-settings/how-do-I-set-up-an-authentication-app/)
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/5-phonenumber.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Add a phone number help image" />

      Each security code expires after 10 minutes and can only be used once. If you don’t enter the security code within 10 minutes, just request a new code. Each code is only good once, so no one can steal one you’ve already used.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/text-confirmation-code.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Phone text confirmation code help image" />

      Type the security code into the field. That’s it! Every time you sign back into your login.gov account, you will receive a new security code that you need to enter. You’ll get the option each time you sign in to get a security code by a phone call or by SMS.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/6-enter-one-time-security-code.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Enter security code help image" />

      #### Save your personal key
      After you’ve created your account, you will get a personal key, which is a set of 16 random characters.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/7-personalkey.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Store your personal key help image" />
      It’s very important that you make a note of your personal key and store it safely. If you lose access to your phone, you can enter the personal key to access your services or applications.

      To make sure you’ve stored your personal key, the last step in creating your account is entering the key you were just given.
      <img src="site.baseurl/assets/img/help/8-personalkey.png" class="mt3 mb3 block" alt="Enter your personal key help image" />

    i-didnt-receive-a-confirmation-email-from-logingov: |-
      If you didn't receive a confirmation email, check your spam filter. Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If so, you can always make another account with your correct email address.

      - If you mistyped your address, you can create a new account.
      - If you are certain you entered the correct address, choose “Send again” to get a new confirmation email.
    what-do-i-do-if-an-account-already-exists-under-my-email-address: |-
      Confirming access to an email address is the first step in creating a login.gov account. If you received a notice that there is already a login.gov account associated with your email address, but you don't remember creating it, use your email address to go through the [password reset process and sign in](site.baseurl/help/signing-in/how-do-i-reset-my-password).

      [Why do I need to use login.gov to access government services online?](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/why-do-i-need-to-use-logingov-to-access-government-services-online/)

    what-is-two-factor-authentication: login.gov uses two-factor authentication to
      keep accounts secure. As its name implies, two-factor authentication (sometimes
      called 2FA), requires two different methods to sign into an account. Usually
      this means entering a memorized password and a unique code sent to a device
      (such as a phone) that you own. Requiring two methods makes breaking into your
      account much harder.
    why-didnt-i-receive-a-security-code-to-confirm-my-phone: |-
      If you didn't receive a security code, check whether you entered your phone number correctly.

      - Did you enter a wrong phone number? Look for the option to enter it again. If you have a non-U.S. number, make sure you select the correct country code. 
      - If you have a landline, please make sure to pick the “Phone call” option under “How would you like to receive your security code?” We cannot send a text message to landlines.
      - If you have an international phone number, make sure you select to receive the security code by text message. login.gov does not support sending security codes to international landlines at this time.
      - If the number you’ve entered is correct, make sure you have service and request the code again. You can receive the code by text message or by a phone call.
    why-do-i-need-to-confirm-my-email-address-and-my-phone-number: login.gov uses
      your email address and phone number to send important security messages about
      account activity. We won't use them for any other purposes, and we won't share
      them with anyone without your express permission.
    why-do-i-need-to-use-logingov-to-access-government-services-online: |-
      Government agencies decide for themselves how they want to interact with the public. You were sent to login.gov because the service or program you want to use has chosen to take advantage of the efficiency and security of login.gov as a shared technology platform. Once you have finished at login.gov, you will be directed back to the agency.

      We hope login.gov is a convenient and secure option for you. However, if you prefer not to use login.gov, you can always access government services. You'll find more information at your agency.

    why-is-my-confirmation-link-invalid: |-
      Email confirmation links expire after 24 hours. select “resend” to get a new confirmation email or start the process over by selecting “create account” and entering your email address.

      If you have requested more than one confirmation email, you must use the most recent email. All links in older emails will be invalid. 

      If the confirmation link still does not work and you have done the steps outlined above, it is possible your email provider has scrambled the link. One way to determine if this has happened is by copying and pasting the confirmation link into your browser. If there are any unusual symbols or words in the link, remove them and hit enter. 

      For additional help, please send an email to [hello@login.gov](mailto:hello@login.gov).
    what-is-my-personal-key: |-
      A personal key is a 16-character secret code we give you when you create an account. The personal key is the only way to sign in if you lose access to the device you use for two-factor authentication. 
      
      You can only use your personal key once.  You will receive a new personal key each time you use it to sign in, and your old one will no longer work.
      
      Because a personal key is the only way to recover your account, make sure to store it in a safe place. Some good ways of storing your personal key include writing it down, taking a screenshot, pasting it into a secure document, or making a printout of it.

Be careful about sharing personal information such as your login credentials, financial information, or Social Security number over email.
    how-do-i-make-my-password-strong: |-
      Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.

      When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and common misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your company name or your spouse's or children's names - and even your pet - as well as other personal information such as your age or birth date.

      If you're already signed in, and you're trying to change your password, email, or phone, you will be prompted to enter your current password before you can make the changes.

      But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left unattended. In that case, for your security, we sign you out after three failed attempts.

      login.gov respects your privacy. We collect personal data online only to help you fulfill your requests with federal agencies that partner with us. login.gov manages specific parts of that agency's website so we collect personal data in order to provide a secure and private environment for you to access certain government services. We are bound by our privacy policy. login.gov does not lease, sell or release your personal information to private companies, contractors, or vendors for marketing purposes.

      login.gov links to external federal government sites for services provided by those agencies. Those sites are subject to their own privacy policy, which is usually spelled out in a privacy policy and legal disclaimer available on their website.

      Individual accounts get a double layer of security. We require two-factor authentication as well as strong passwords that meet new [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"} requirements for secure validation and verification. This includes two-factor authentication that requires you log in with your password and a security code you receive on your phone. Two-factor authentication can help protect your account against password compromises.

      You must have a login.gov account to sign into SAM.gov. If you don’t have a login.gov account, you need to create one. **Your old SAM.gov username and password won’t work anymore.**

      **To create a login.gov account:**

        1. Start from the [sam.gov](https://www.sam.gov/){:target="_blank"} portal and select the Log in button.
        2. Choose Create an Account to start creating a login.gov account.
        3. Confirm an email address during the account set up. If you are a returning SAM.gov user, you must use the email address registered with SAM.gov to link your profile information to your login.gov account.
        4. Create a new password.
        5. Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) near you - login.gov will send you a security code each time you sign in.
        6. Finish setting up your login.gov account by writing down the personal key.

      Once you’ve finished setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to SAM.gov where you should see your profile. You need to use your login.gov email address, password, and security code every time you want to sign into SAM.gov.
    where-is-my-profile-info: |-
      If you are an existing SAM user and don’t see your SAM.gov profile after signing in, this means you did not use the same email address you registered with SAM.gov. To update your email address to match your SAM.gov registered email you’ll need to:

        1. Go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and
        2. select “Manage Account” to sign in
        3. select “edit” next to your email
        4. Enter the correct email address and select “update”
        5. You will be sent a confirmation email. You must open and select the confirmation link to finish updating your email

        If you can’t remember the email you registered with SAM.gov, you can contact the Federal Service Desk at 866-606-8220 (toll fee) or 334-206-7828 (internationally) for assistance. You may also submit your request via web form at [www.fsd.gov](https://www.fsd.gov/){:target="_blank"}.

        If you no longer have access to the email you used to create your SAM.gov profile, you will need to create a new SAM.gov profile with your new login.gov account.
    no-longer-have-email: |-
      If you no longer have access to the email you used to create your SAM.gov profile, you will need to create a new SAM.gov profile with your new login.gov account. You need to have access to the email in order to receive the login.gov confirmation email. Unfortunately, SAM will not be able to link your profile and information to your account.
    change-account-settings: |-
      To make changes and updates to information tied to your login.gov account (email, phone number, personal key, etc.), you must sign in to your login.gov account:

        1. Go to [https://www.login.gov/](https://www.login.gov/) and select “Manage Account”
        2. Sign in using your login.gov credentials

      Once logged in, you will be able to edit and update your login.gov information.

      To make changes to your SAM.gov account, you will need to sign in at [https://www.sam.gov](https://sam.gov){:target="_blank"}. Once signed in to your SAM account:

        1. Select My Account Settings from the sub-navigation menu on your My SAM page.
        2. Select Edit User Information.

      You will not be able to update your SAM username or email address. To update the email address associated with your SAM account, please update your login.gov account.
    have-account-different-email: |-
      Your login.gov email address must be the same as your SAM.gov email address to successfully link your SAM profile to your login.gov account. If you have already created a login.gov account, but with an email address that is different from your SAM.gov registered email you can do the following:
        1. **Update your SAM.gov email**: Before 6:00 pm EST on Friday, June 29th, you can update your SAM.gov email to the email address you used to create your login.gov account. When you sign on to SAM.gov using login.gov for the first time, your profile will automatically link.
        2. **Change your login.gov email**: You can change your login.gov email to match your SAM.gov email address. You must change your login.gov email before signing into SAM using login.gov. Changing your email will not affect your profiles with other government applications, and once you’ve signed into SAM.gov and linked your profile, you can change your login.gov email back to the original email used. To change your login.gov email, do the following:
        3. **Create another login.gov account**: You can also create a new login.gov account using the same email registered with SAM.
    relink-my-profile: |-
      If you cannot sign into your SAM account because you’ve permanently lost access to your security method and personal key, you can reset your account by deleting it. 

      Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will allow you to use the same email address and set up new security options. However, deleting will unlink your SAM profile. You must follow the below steps to relink your account:

      1. To delete your account, sign in at [https://sam.gov/](https://sam.gov/). When you are prompted to enter your security code, scroll to the bottom of the page to the section that says “If you can't use any of these security options above, you can reset your preferences by deleting your account,” and follow that link. 
      2. Read through all the information carefully to make sure deleting your account is the only way to reset your account settings. select "Yes, continue deletion" to proceed. 
      3. You will immediately receive an email confirmation that your delete request was received. As a security measure, you will receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours after the initial confirmation arrives.  
      4. After you delete your account, go to [https://sam.gov/](https://sam.gov/) to create a new account.
      5. If you have used the correct email address, your SAM profile will automatically link once you’ve signed in.
    why-is-sam-using-login-gov: |-
      login.gov uses two-factor authentication, and stronger passwords, that meet new [National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/){:target="_blank"} requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you’ll get an extra layer of security to help protect your SAM.gov profile against password compromises.
        - **Do I have to create a login.gov account to sign into SAM?**
          You must create a new account with login.gov. This is a one-time step. For existing SAM users, you should use your existing SAM.gov email address. For new users, you will be able to create a new SAM profile once you complete the login.gov authentication.
        - **What will happen to my SAM Profile?**
          Nothing will happen to the information stored in your SAM.gov account and profile. If you use the same email to create your login.gov profile, you will keep all of your records, data access requests, and saved searches. If you use a new email address, nothing will happen to your SAM.gov profile, but you will be unable to access it.
        - **What email address should I use to create a login.gov account?**
          If you are an existing SAM user, use the same email address you registered within SAM.gov so we can automatically link your SAM.gov profile to your login.gov account. If you use a different email address, we won't be able to link your profile automatically.

        2. When you are prompted to enter your security code, select the link that says “choose another security option.” 
        3. On the “Select your security option” page, choose “personal key.”
        4. Enter the original personal key you received when you created your account.
        5. You will receive a new personal key. Enter it into the field, select “Continue.” *NOTE*: You will be given a new personal key every time you use it to sign in. If you plan to use your personal key each time, you must always use the newest version of it.
      
      If you have permanently lost access to your phone and you don’t have your personal key, login.gov cannot recover your account for security reasons. Your only options are to delete your current login.gov account so you can create a new one using the same email address or create a new login.gov account using a new email address.

      Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will allow you to use the same email address and set up new security options. However, deleting will remove any agency applications you have linked to your account. We recommend you use the articles listed below to learn how to relink your account after deleting it.

      To delete your account, either sign in via your agency application or by visiting [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/). When you are prompted to enter your security code, select the link that says “choose another security option.” On the next page, scroll to the bottom to the section that says “If you can’t use any of these security options above, you can reset your preferences by deleting your account,” and follow that link.
  
    i-forgot-which-email-address-i-used-to-create-an-account: |-
      If you can't remember which email address you used to create your account, you can use the password reset function to see if your email address is on file.

      Try to sign in as usual and ask to have your password reset. Then, enter the email address you believe you used to create your account. If we have your email address in our records, we will send instructions on how to reset your password. Check your email in a few minutes for these instructions.
  
    how-do-i-turn-off-two-factor-authentication: |-
      login.gov does not allow you to turn off two-factor authentication, but you can set up the "remember browser" feature. This will allow you to sign in without entering a security code for 30 days. Every 30 days you will be required to renew this feature by going through the normal two-factor authentication steps and selecting "remember browser." NOTE: If you use login.gov on multiple devices and browsers, you must set up “remember browser” on each one. 
        
        1. Enter email and password to begin sign in process.
        2. Enter the security code and select “Remember this browser for 30 days”. 
        3. After setting up "remember browser," you will not be prompted to enter a security code for 30 days.

    if-i-dont-have-my-phone-with-me-can-i-still-sign-in: |-
      It is necessary to have your phone in order to get the security key to sign in. But if you don't have your phone with you, you will need the personal key you received when you created your account. Enter the personal key when instructed and select submit. Once you are signed in, you will immediately get a new personal key. Please store the personal key in a safe place separately from your phone since the personal key will let you sign in to your account in case you don't have your phone with you.

      We encourage you to store your personal key somewhere other than your computer or mobile device — this way, you'll be able to access your personal key even if your device is stolen or your online accounts are hacked.
    how-do-i-reset-my-password: |-
      If you don't know your password, the link to reset it is on the sign-in page. Enter your email address to receive a link to reset your password. Once you follow the link, you'll be asked to enter a new password. Your password must be 9 characters long and clear the password strength meter. select "show password" to ensure you are typing your password correctly. You will be taken back to the sign in page after completing these steps. You can now sign in using your new login.gov password.
    what-do-i-need-to-have-in-order-to-sign-in: Every time you log into your account,
      you will need your email address, your password, and access to your phone. After
      you have entered your email address and password, login.gov will send to your
      phone a security code, which you will need to enter into the security code field
      in order to be logged in securely.
    why-is-my-security-code-invalid: Every time you sign in you will need to enter a security code that is sent to your phone either by a text message or a phone call. The security code you receive expires after 10 minutes and is only valid for one use. If you miss entering the security code within the 10 minutes or you missed the phone call, you can request a new security code. Each security code is only good once, so make sure you are using the most recent security code. You can only request 3 security codes every 15 minutes, but otherwise, you can request as many codes as you need.

    why-am-i-locked-out-of-logingov: |-
      There are several ways you can be temporarily locked out of login.gov. 
        - You will be unable to login for 10 minutes if you incorrectly enter your security code 3 times.  
        - You will be unable to login for 10 minutes if you request more than 10 security codes in a 5 minute time period.  

    why-didnt-i-receive-a-security-code: |-
      If you didn’t receive a security code, check whether you entered your phone number correctly.
        - Did you enter a wrong phone number? Look for the option to enter it again. If you have a non-U.S. number, make sure you select the correct country code. 
        - If you have a landline, please make sure to pick the “Phone call” option under “How would you like to receive your security code?” We cannot send a text message to landlines.
        - If you have an international phone number, make sure you select to receive the security code by text message. login.gov does not support sending security codes by phone call to international numbers at this time.
        - If it's the right number, make sure you have service and request the code again. You can receive the code by text message or by a phone call.

    my-reset-password-link-is-invalid: |-
      Reset password links expire after 6 hours. If this has happened, select “Resend” to get a new reset password link or select “forgot password” and enter your email address.

      If you have requested more than one reset password link, you must use the link in the most recent email. All links in older emails will be invalid.

      If the reset password link still does not work and you have done the steps outlined above, it is possible your email provider has scrambled the link. One way to determine if this has happened is by copying and pasting the confirmation link into your browser. If there are any unusual symbols or words in the link, remove them and hit enter.

    why-didnt-I-receive-a-reset-password-email-from-logingov: |-
      If you didn't receive a reset email, check your spam filter. If you add “no-reply@login.gov” to your contact list, your email provider will not send it to spam. Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If you are confident you entered the correct address, choose "Send again" to get a new password reset email. If you are still not receiving emails, we recommend you contact your email provider about the issue or check your account settings if you are forwarding your email.

    why-is-my-personal-key-invalid: |-
      A personal key is a 16-character secret code we give you when you create an account. The personal key is the only way to sign in if you lose access to the device you use for two-factor authentication. You can only use your personal key once.  You will receive a new personal key each time you use it to sign in, and your old one will no longer work.

      If you are being told your personal key is invalid, you have either typed it in incorrectly or you have already used it to sign in and it is no longer valid. If you have already used your personal key to sign in, you were given a new one that must be used to sign in.

        To find your USAJOBS profile, follow these steps:

          1. Sign into USAJOBS
          2. select the “find existing profile” button
          3. Enter your email address and select “send email”
          4. Check your email and follow the instructions to confirm your account.

        If you receive an email that says the email address is not associated with a USAJOBS account, we recommend trying to link your profile using a different email. 

        If you are unable to link your profile or you no longer have access to the email address you used to create your USAJOBS profile, you can select “lost access to your email addresses” to contact the USAJOBS Help Center for additional support or use this link: [https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/faq/account/no-profile/](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/faq/account/no-profile/)

    security-code: |-
      You can choose to receive the one time security code via text or phone call if you have a U.S. based cell phone. Landlines can only receive a phone call. If you’re outside the U.S., most phone numbers can only receive a text.

      As an alternative to receiving a text or phone call, you can also [use an authentication app after successfully creating your account](/help/signing-in/what-is-an-authentication-app/).
    gov-mil-edu-email-address: |-
      We recommend you don’t use a .gov, .mil or .edu email address, because if you leave your government or military position or school, you won’t have access to that email address anymore. Without access to that email address, it will be much harder to verify who you are, if you need to reset your password.

      If your USAJOBS primary or secondary email address is a .gov, .mil or .edu email address, you may want to consider changing it AFTER you get through the login.gov account set-up and USAJOBS profile linking process.

    relink-my-profile: |-
      If you cannot sign into your USAJOBS account because you’ve permanently lost access to your security method and personal key, you can reset your account by deleting it. 

      Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will allow you to use the same email address and set up new security options. However, deleting will unlink your USAJOBS profile. You must follow the below steps to relink your account

      1. To delete your account, sign in at [https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/){:target="_blank"}. When you are prompted to enter your security code, scroll to the bottom of the page to the section that says “If you can't use any of these security options above, you can reset your preferences by deleting your account,” and follow that link. 
      2. Read through all the information carefully to make sure deleting your account is the only way to reset your account settings and select "Yes, continue deletion" to proceed. 
      3. You will immediately receive an email confirmation that your delete request was received. As a security measure, you will receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours after the initial confirmation arrives.  
      4. After you delete your account, you must contact the USAJOBS helpdesk to unlink your account. You will have to answer security questions to do this. NOTE You must first unlink your account before creating a new one. If you do not unlink your account before you create a new one, we will not be able to link your accounts. 
      5. Go to [https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/){:target="_blank"} to create a new login.gov account, using the same email address.
      6. If you followed these steps in this order and used the correct email, your profile will automatically link.

      If you have any questions about linking your account, please contact the USAJOBS helpdesk. 
    im-trying-to-sign-in-but-it-doesnt-work: |-
      USAJOBS recently switched their login system to login.gov. Your USAJOBS username and password no longer work. You must create a login.gov account to sign.
      
      To automatically link your USAJOBS profile to your new account, you must use your primary or secondary USAJOBS email. If you don't sign up with one of these emails, we won't be able to link your profile automatically, but you can use your USAJOBS primary or secondary email address to try and recover your profile once logged in.

      To register a new account:  
        1. Go to [https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/)
        2. select “Sign in”
        3. select “Continue”
        4. If you have not created a login.gov account, select "Create an account." If you already have a login.gov account, select "Sign in."
        5. Enter your email address: this is your new username going forward
        6. Wait for an email confirmation & follow the instructions in the email
        7. Continue with the account creation process as described here: [https://login.gov/help/creating-an-account/how-do-i-create-an-account-with-logingov/](site.baseurl/help/creating-an-account/how-do-i-create-an-account-with-logingov/)

      If you sign in and don’t see your profile, you can try to recover your account by selecting “Already have a USAJOBS profile.” USAJOBS will walk you through a few steps to find your profile.
      
      If you’re still having issues linking your profile, contact the USAJOBS Help Center. [https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/how-to/account/#usajobs-contact-form](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/how-to/account/#usajobs-contact-form)

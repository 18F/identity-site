    create-your-account: |-
      Follow these steps to create your login.gov account.

      1. Enter your email address at [https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email](https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email) to begin.

          Choose an email address that you’ll always be able to access. Once your account is created, you can add an additional email address, such as a work email or alternate personal address, to access your account.
      1. Click the __“Submit”__ button.
      1. Check your email for a message from login.gov.
      1. Click the __“Confirm your email address”__ button in the message. This will take you back to the login.gov website.
      1. Create your login.gov password.

          Passwords must be at least 12 characters. That's it! There are no other restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 12 characters. Try using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize.

          Your login.gov password should be different from passwords you use for other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same password for many accounts makes identity theft easier.
      1. Set up a second layer of security.

          As an added layer of protection, login.gov requires you set up a secondary authentication method to keep your account secure. This is referred to as two-factor authentication (2FA).

          While we only require one secondary authentication method, we encourage you to add two methods to your account. That way you will have a backup if you lose access to your primary authentication method.

          You can choose from several authentication options.

          __More secure:__
          * Authentication application
          * Security key
          * PIV or CAC card for federal government employees or military

          __Less secure:__
          * Text message
          * Phone call
          * Backup codes

          [Learn more about each authentication option](site.baseurl/help/get-started/authentication-options) to choose the one that is right for you.

      1. Success! Once you have authenticated, you have created your login.gov account.
      {: .number-list}

      You will be taken to your login.gov account page or the government agency you are trying to access. You can add additional authentication methods, email addresses or update your information on the login.gov account page.

    authentication-options: |-
      In addition to your password, login.gov requires that you set up at least one secondary authentication method to keep your account secure. This is two-factor authentication (2FA). We use 2FA as an added layer of protection to secure your information.

      __Secondary authentication__
      We encourage you to add two methods for authentication to your account. If you lose access to your primary authentication method (i.e. losing your phone), you’ll have a second option to use to get access to your account. Login.gov is unable to grant you access to your account if you get locked out and/or lose your authentication method.

      __Security__
      Although you can choose from several authentication options, some authentication methods such as Security Keys, PIV/CAC cards and authentication applications are more secure against phishing and theft.

      ## Authentication application
      Authentication applications are downloaded to your device and generate secure, six-digit codes you use to sign in to your accounts. While authentication applications are not protected if your device is lost or stolen, this method offers more security than phone calls or text messaging against phishing, hacking, or interception.

      If you choose this secure option, follow these steps to download and install one of the supported applications and configure it to work with login.gov.

      1. Choose a device, such as a computer or mobile device (phone or tablet), on which you can install apps.
      1. Download and install an authentication app to your device. Some popular options include:
        * Android options: [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/).
        * iOS options: [Google Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [LastPass](https://1password.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/).
        * Windows apps: [1Password](https://1password.com/), [OTP Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/otp-manager/9nblggh6hngn).
        * Mac apps: [1Password](https://1password.com/), [OTP Manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otp-manager/id928941247?mt=12).
        * Chrome extensions: [Authenticator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai?hl=en).
      1. Open a new browser and sign in to your login.gov account at [https://secure.login.gov/](https://secure.login.gov/).
      1. Select “Enable” next to “Authentication app” and follow the instructions to scan or enter a code associating your authentication app with your account.
      {: .number-list}

      You will now be able to use the one-time passcodes generated by the application each time you sign in to login.gov.

      ## Security key
      A security key is typically an external physical device, like a USB, that you plug into your computer. The key is linked to your accounts and will only grant access to those accounts once the key is plugged in and activated. Since a security key does not rely on your cell phone, it has the highest level of protection against phishing and built-in protections against hacking if it is lost or stolen.

      Login.gov requires security keys that meet the [FIDO (Fast Identity Online) standards](https://fidoalliance.org/). You can add as many security keys as you want to secure your account.

      To use this secure option for login.gov authentication, plug the key into a USB port and assign the key a name to identify it with your login.gov account. The next step will ask you to activate your key. This is generally done by pressing a button on the key itself.

      ## PIV or CAC for federal government employees and military
      Physical PIV (personal identity verification) cards or CACs (common access cards) are secure options for federal government employees and military personnel. These cards, with encrypted chip technology, are resistant to phishing and difficult to hack if stolen.

      ## Text message / Phone call
      Text messages/SMS or phone calls are convenient but are extremely vulnerable to theft, hackers, and other attacks.

      If you choose to use this less secure option, enter a phone number at which you can receive phone calls or text messages. If you only have a landline, you must receive your security code by phone call. Login.gov cannot send security codes to extensions or voicemails.

      We will send a unique security code to that phone number each time you sign in to your login.gov account. Each security code expires after ten minutes and can only be used once. If you don’t enter the security code within ten minutes, request a new code.

      After you receive the code, type it into the “one-time security code” field. Each time you sign in to login.gov you’ll have the option of getting a new security code by phone call or by text. You will receive a new security code each time you sign in to your login.gov account.

      ## Backup codes (less secure)
      Backup codes are an accessible option for users who do not have access to a phone. However, backup codes are the least secure option for two-factor authentication. Backup codes must be printed or written down which makes them more vulnerable to theft and phishing.

      If you select this less secure option, login.gov will generate a set of ten codes. After you sign in with your username and password, you will be prompted for a code. Each code may be used only once. When the tenth code has been used you will be prompted to download a new list. Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password.

      ## No phone or other authentication method
      If you do not have access to a phone, authentication application, security key, or any other authentication option, you can set up your account with only backup codes.

      __Warning:__ Setting up your account with backup codes as your only authentication method is not recommended. If you ever lose your backup codes, you will not be able to sign in to your account.

      When you create your account, you will reach the “Secure your account” page. This is where you must choose your primary authentication method. If you do not have access to any of the other options, select “Backup codes” and click “Continue.”

      On the “Add another method” page, select “I don’t have any of the above” and click “Continue.”

      # Delete your account

      __There might be different reasons why you need to delete an account:__

      * You realize you have multiple accounts using different email addresses and you want to have one account
      * You are locked out of your account and have lost access to your authentication methods
      * You no longer need a login.gov account

      __If you delete your account:__
      * We'll delete your email address, password, and phone number
      * You won't be able to securely access partner agencies who require a login.gov account

      After you delete your account, you will not be able to sign in to the government applications that you normally use your login.gov account to access. You will not lose your information in those applications, but you will need a new login.gov account to be able to sign in to those applications.

      __If you do have access to your authentication methods, follow these steps to delete your account:__

      1. Enter your email address at [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov).
      1. Enter your password.

  verify-your-identity:
    overview: |-
      Some participating agencies require you to complete an identity verification process. Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

      You only need to verify your identity once for your login.gov account. After you verify your identity with login.gov for one government application, you don’t need to do it again for other government applications that use login.gov and require identity verification.

      Use this help section to understand the process and requirements for identity verification.

      ## Common troubleshooting topics

    how-to-verify-your-identity: |-
      Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

      You will need to verify your identity and secure your account.

      ## Requirements for identity verification
      1. Your State-Issued ID. You can upload a photo by phone or by computer. Don’t have a state issued ID?
      1. A phone or computer with a camera to take a photo of yourself (not always required)
      1. Social Security Number
      1. A phone number on a phone plan that is in your name.
          * If you do not have a phone plan that is in your name, we can send you the verification code by mail which takes approximately 3-5 days.

      If you are missing any of this information, please contact the government agency you are trying to access.

      ## Our privacy and security standards
      Login.gov is a secure, government website that adheres to the highest standards in data protection. Most of the data you submit is not stored. Learn how we verify your identity and the [privacy and security measures](site.baseurl/policy) we take to keep your information safe.

      ## Steps for identity verification and securing your account
      1. On the “We need to verify your identity” page, read the requirements and, if you agree, check the box next to the login.gov consent statement.
          * Click “Continue”
      1. Next, upload your State-Issued ID.
          * Note: If you began the identity verification process on your computer, you have the option to switch and use your phone to upload images.

          **Continue by computer and upload images**

          * Upload an image of the FRONT of your state-issued ID by clicking on “Choose File.”
              * Select the file from your computer
          * Upload an image of the BACK of your state-issued ID by clicking on “Choose File.”
              * Select the file from your computer
              * Click continue

          **Switch from computer to phone to upload images**

          * Enter your phone number.
              * Choose a phone number where you can receive SMS/Text messages and click “Continue.”
          * Click on the link sent to your phone.
          * You will see options to either “take a photo” or “upload a photo.”
              * Upload an image of the FRONT of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the front of your ID
              * Upload an image of the BACK of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the back of your ID
          * Return to computer to complete the process

          **Continue by phone and upload images**

          * You will see a screen with ‘front’ and ‘back’ in large squares and an option to either “take a photo” or “upload a photo.”
              * Upload an image of the FRONT of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the front of your ID
              * Upload an image of the BACK of your ID from your phone’s photo gallery or take an image of the back of your ID
          * Click “Continue”
      1.  For some applications, you may be asked to take a photo of yourself. If the “Take a Photo of Yourself” screen appears, follow the guidelines to take a photo of yourself using either your computer, switching from your computer to phone, or only using your phone.
          * Once you have an acceptable photo, Click “Submit”
          * Your images will process and if accepted, an acceptance message will appear and you can continue the process.
          * If rejected, please review the error message and resubmit your photo.
      1.  Enter your social security number and click “Continue”
      1.  Verify the information you have submitted so far is correct and click “Continue”
      1.  Enter a phone number with your name on the plan. This is the last step for identity verification.
          * If you do not have a phone plan with your name on it or a U.S. phone number, click on “Get a code via mail instead.” You will have to wait to receive a letter in the mail and then follow the instructions to enter the code.
      1.  Once your identity is verified, you need to encrypt your account. Re-enter your login.gov password. Click “Continue”
      1.  Take note of your personal key and keep it safe. You’ll need to enter your personal key immediately on the next page. Click “Continue”

    heading_2: 'You might not need to implement an identity system if:'
    heading_3: To answer this, ask
    heading_4: What kinds of resources do you already have to identify customers?
    heading_5: To answer this, ask
    heading_6: What is a consumer identity management system?
    heading_7: What is an identity?
    heading_8: How does identity and access management work?
    heading_9: What does having an identity record enable?
    p_1: It’s worth assessing what you really need before beginning implementation.
      Not all information requires an identity system to manage access. You can protect
      the privacy of users and reduce the security risk to your systems by avoiding
      any unnecessary collection of personally identifiable information — this even
      includes contact details.
    p_2: Your agency may already have mission-specific information and resources that
      can be used to identify customers. By integrating resources you know and trust,
      you can increase the reliability of identification.
    p_3: When you’re at home and someone knocks at your door it’s easy enough to decide
      whether or not to answer. Based on your knowledge of who’s outside, you can
      decide whether to open the door. Is the person outside a friend? A mail carrier
      or other expected service provider? A complete stranger? Online, the question
      of deciding “who’s there” is much harder. Consumer identity management systems
      make it easier for system administrators to decide whether or not to open the
      door, and how wide.
    p_4: In the world of security, “identity” has a very specific technical meaning
      that differs from a plain English sense. An “identity” in technical terms is
      a special kind of record — a bundle of different types of data that together
      describes only one system user [NIST 800-63-3]. That data can include references
      to official government records, such as driver’s license numbers and registered
      birth dates, as well as more mutable data such as email addresses and usernames.
      Physical attributes such as fingerprints and DNA can also be part of an identity
      record.
    p_5: System administrators assign access privileges to each identity record. These
      privileges authorize certain activities and forbid others. To “open the door”
      safely, however, administrators need confidence that the users knocking at the
      door are who they say they are.
    p_6: To give the system and its administrators confidence in their identities,
      users need to prove their identities through an activity called authentication.
      Users authenticate themselves by presenting evidence linking themselves to records.
      To do that, users first help the system validate their record — for example,
      by typing in a username. Then users hand over the evidence — often, passwords
      or other information only the real person would know.
    p_7: 'Identity systems don’t just benefit system administrators. Users can do
      some very handy things with an authenticated digital identity. Here’s a small
      list:'
    ul_1:
      li_1: You do not need to have an ongoing relationship with users.
      li_2: Transactions don’t depend upon personal information being accurate.
      li_3: You can rely on other forms of security.
    ul_2:
      li_1:
        content: What transactions will users need?
        p_1: Will the transactions be ongoing, as when users bookmark benefits or
          grant applications to fill out later, then return repeatedly to check the
          application status? Or will they be a one-time or infrequent, as when people
          download medical or financial records?
      li_2:
        content: What kind of information do you need to protect your customers?
        p_1: Do you need full name and other personal information so that users can
          access private information? Or do you only need to verify that a user fits
          in certain categories, such as the veterans category or the senior citizens
          category?
      li_3:
        content: What sort of crime might access to this information make possible?
        p_1: Information that seems innocent on its own might still be valuable to
          fraudsters and other criminals in combination with other easily accessed
          information.
      li_4:
        content: What other means of security are available?
        p_1: Postal tracking numbers, for example, are not secrets because the package
          will only be delivered to a specific address. The safety of the delivery
          rests on the security of the building and the conduct of the delivery person,
          not on the secrecy of the number itself.
    ul_3:
      li_1:
        content: What resources are unique to your agency?
        p_1: Individuals’ confidential interactions with government agencies can generate
          a trail of metadata. Used carefully, that metadata can facilitate identity
          verification based on knowledge of those activities. Other government organizations
          serve as authoritative repositories of biometric data available for internal
          use. Some agencies may have physical locations that customers can visit.
    ul_4:
      li_1:
        span_1: Pre-filling online forms with verified information speeds up application
          processing.
        span_2: There’s less redundant effort, and users don’t need to worry about
          basic errors.
      li_2:
        span_1: Authenticated users can access and download data the system holds
          about them, such as account activity.
        span_2: With a verified legal identity, the user can access very sensitive
          medical or financial records and even download them.
      li_3:
        span_1: Identity systems can protect your privacy.
        span_2: If you need to be 21 or older to access a service, you can authorize
          an identity system to confirm your age without sharing your exact birth
          date.

        ## Login.gov is committed to your privacy and security ## {#intro}

        This describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect your personal information. Protecting your information is our priority at login.gov.

        The information that you submit is used to create or update your login.gov account and give you access to login.gov’s partner agencies. When you provide your email address or other proof of identity like a state ID, we can be sure it’s really you and grant you access to the account — and keep the bad actors away. This proof, called an electronic identity assurance credential, is like putting a key into a lock and securely opens the door to the government agency’s application or service.

        ###  How we work with our partner agencies: ### {#how-we-work-with-our-partner-agencies}

        * Login.gov partners with government agencies to provide secure access to their website, application or service. The partner agency (e.g. United States Office of Personnel Management) selects the type of information we request from you.
            * We ask primarily for information to authenticate your account and/or prove your identity.
        * When you create a login.gov account, you consent to share personally identifiable  information (PII). The information that you need to share depends on the request of the partner agency.
            * For authentication to establish a secure account, we need your name, email address, and an authentication method. Your authentication method could be a phone number where we share a SMS code, USB Security Key or other options.
            * Identity proofing requires more sensitive information such as a social security number, address, phone number connected to your address, and U.S. based state ID or driver’s license.
        * When users visit login.gov, either to access their account or not, we anonymously aggregate some data. No individually identifying information is attached to this data. We aggregate information such as the pages visited, web browser type and version, and the length of your session to help us improve the login.gov experience.
            * For example;  If you experience an error and we know your web browser type and version, we can better identify how to fix your issue.
        * Stored information is encrypted at two levels. Encryption translates your data into code that is only accessible by you, the login.gov account holder.  This means you are the only one who can view and make changes to your account information.
            * The login.gov operators (i.e. our contact help center) cannot view your information or make any changes.
            * Information is stored and deleted according to the [National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) approved record schedule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01174/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-new-system-of-records).

        Protecting your information is our priority. You can read below for a more detailed explanation of our privacy and security practices.

        You can read more detailed explanations about [how login.gov works](site.baseurl/policy/how-does-it-work/), [our privacy act statement](site.baseurl/policy/our-privacy-act-statement/), and [our security practices](site.baseurl/policy/our-security-practices/).

        ## How does it work ## {#how-does-it-work}

        Login.gov encrypts your personal information in transit and at rest and asks you before sharing your data with a partner agency. In order to reuse identity assurance credentials across government websites login.gov conforms to the NIST 800-63-3A specification.

        During identity proofing, the ID is also checked for authenticity. Then, the personal information is validated with the issuing source (ex: state DMVs) or authoritative sources (ex: credit, financial, telephone records). These external services do not retain any personal information, they are only used for validation purposes. Given these stringent requirements, login.gov currently supports state IDs and federal government employee IDs. Over time, login.gov will support additional IDs.

        Your address is also validated during this process. This can be done remotely using a telephone number associated with the address or through a letter with an enrollment code sent to the account holder's address. Please note, the enrollment code is valid for 30 days. (5-10 days for the letter to be delivered along with 10 days to complete address validation on [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov)). Once validated, login.gov identity credentials are encrypted with the account holder's password. Encryption ensures that only you, the account holder, can access your information with your password.

        Protecting your privacy through encryption does come at a cost. Login.gov operators, such as our Contact Center team, cannot make changes on your behalf like unlocking your account, changing your password or updating your email address or phone number. We encourage you to safeguard your authentication method for this reason. While this means login.gov cannot provide that level of customer support, if we chose to make these options available to our customer support team, it would make our system more vulnerable to hacking and other bad actors.

        The information you give login.gov will be shared with the applicable partner agency to provide access to information about you held by that agency as described in the associated systems of records notices. Please note that the login.gov system will record certain session-level information about your use of the service, including but not limited to, web browser type and version, and the length of your session. This information allows login.gov to better understand how the site is being used and how it can be made more helpful.

        ## Our privacy act statement ## {#our-privacy-act-statement}

        The login.gov service is provided by the U.S. General Services Administration to offer the public secure and private online access to participating government programs. With one login.gov account, users can sign into multiple government agencies. Our goal is to make managing federal benefits, services, and applications easier and more secure.

        By accessing the login.gov service, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy and the login.gov Rules of Use. We will post any changes to these terms to this page. If the changes affect our handling of your personal information or are otherwise deemed significant, we will notify you by email. If we cannot reach you by email, we reserve the right to contact you by other means, including postal mail. If at any time you no longer agree to this Privacy Policy or any other relevant terms of the login.gov service, you may close your account.

        ### The Authority - Who authorizes the collection of this data?  ### {#authority}

        The information you provide is collected pursuant to 6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E), the E-Government Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–347, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note), and 40 USC § 501.

        ### The Purpose - Why do we need your information? ### {#purpose}

        Login.gov partners with agencies that need secure and private access to their applications and services. Each agency may request different levels of security depending on their needs. When you create and sign in to a login.gov account, you’re provided with an electronic identity assurance credential. We need your personally identifying information, or PII, to generate that credential. Imagine this credential like a key that only you can use. The key securely opens the door to a partner agency’s service or application.

        #### What information do we need? ####

        * For authentication to establish a secure account, we need your name, email address, and an authentication method. Your authentication method could be a phone number where we share a SMS code, USB Security Key or other options.
        * Identity proofing requires more sensitive information such as a social security number, address, phone number connected to your address, and U.S. based state ID or driver’s license.

        ### Routine Uses - With whom is the information routinely shared? ### {#routine-uses}

        * To third party identity proofing services, as necessary to identity proof an individual for access to a service at the required level of assurance.
        * To an expert, consultant, or contractor of GSA in the performance of a Federal duty to which the information is relevant.
        * To the Government Publishing Office (GPO), when Login.gov needs to mail a user an address confirmation form or if a user requests mailed notifications of account changes or of proofing attempts.

        This list is not comprehensive. Please see the system of records notice for all entities and individuals.

        #### What happens to the information you share? ####

        All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number on [your account page](https://secure.login.gov/account).

        Your email address and phone number will be maintained for at least six years in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) guidance. However, GSA is authorized to maintain the information for longer if it is required for business use. Login.gov must be able to provide users access to information and services at partner agencies and therefore may have a business need to retain the information longer than the six-year retention period.

        There may be circumstances where we are required to share certain data. For example: if the information is relevant and necessary for an authorized law enforcement purpose; in order to respond to a breach; or to assist another agency as it responds to a breach. For additional information, see the system of record notice number GSA/TTS-1 that GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS) published on [August 10, 2017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/10/2017-16852/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records).

        Even when we share the information with law enforcement, with the exception of email, we cannot access PII because the information is encrypted in a manner that is unretrievable to the login.gov team.

        ### Consent - How can you control what information is shared? ### {#consent}

        You decide what information to give us and can revoke consent at any time. Sharing your information is voluntary. All records are stored electronically in a database in GSA’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. You can modify, or amend, either your email address or phone number on [your account page](https://secure.login.gov/account).

        However, failure to provide complete and accurate information may delay access to the partner agency. Login.gov does not make any eligibility or suitability determinations; that is the responsibility of the government websites that use the login.gov service.

        Other than as specified in this Privacy Policy and our Rules of Use, we will never share your information without your consent. Your data is encrypted and the only way to share it with a partner agency is if you, the authorized user, enter your password and explicitly grant consent to share the information.

        When you create an account or visit a new partner agency website after you have created your account, you will see the option to consent to share your information with the partner agency. You are required to give consent yearly for each agency.

        Remember you can update your personal information, revoke consent, or delete your account entirely at any time through [your account page](https://secure.login.gov/account).

        ### Records - Where can you find more information? ### {#records}

        Please see the Login.gov system of records notice (GSA/TTS–1) at [www.gsa.gov/SORN](https://www.gsa.gov/SORN).

        ### Website Analytics - Other data we collect ### {#analytics}

        Other data, like the pages you visit and the length of your session, are aggregated into reports to help us better understand how the site is being used and how we can make it more helpful. The data is anonymized. No personally identifying user information is tied to this data and it is only shared anonymously with the login.gov team.

    Solving real problems for potential users should be the focus for any system, and is doubly important when building an identity management system. Throughout this playbook, you’ll see how satisfying user needs is a guiding principle in every decision made.

    One of the first steps you should take is identifying your core users. For login.gov, we’ve identified two groups as our core users: the general public and tech people inside government agencies. The goal for the system itself is to support and address the needs of the general public. To put it plainly, we want to make sure that our system makes people comfortable with logging in to government services. The public needs to feel confident that login.gov behaves as expected and will not disappoint them. The system also needs to address users’ entire experience as they try to accomplish their goals. Because identity verification and authentication is technologically complex, it’s not unlikely that even the most tech-savvy people could get stuck if their phone is lost or a system has errors. So in support of each agency’s mission, architects and designers of consumer identity management systems need to anticipate likely sticking points so that people don’t lose access to the services and benefits.

    Agencies should figure out what portion of the public they serve and how services can be built to address their needs specifically. This will help agency integration teams understand what they need if they decide to implement the login.gov platform or any other consumer identity management system.

    Finally, you should continuously test designs and tools as they’re ready to share and then adjust your project based on what you learn. In some cases, we learn that the current best practices aren’t good enough. And in those cases we’re pushed to try out new ways to give the users the best experience possible. That process involves further testing, educating users, and a willingness to iterate.

    There are a number of specific design methods we practice to remain user-centered, and you can read about all of them, and use them yourself, by reviewing the [18F Design Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/).
  p_2: |-
    [Working transparently](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13) and creating a transparent system should be the way any agency works when building or implementing an identity management system. To execute this principle with login.gov, we’re building the platform so that interested parties can advise us on best practices and so that we remain accountable to the public and to our partners across the government. Further, it means building a system that tells users what it does with their information to create accountability and build trust. We’re engaging users and other interested parties through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp) and working on creating public forums where people can discuss our work.

    To make an identity management system transparent for end users, the system you build should include features that educate people about how the system works, why it works that way, and how they can control what’s happening with their data. You should also let users know what information is needed by an agency when logging in to a service. It’s also important to tell users what information your systems will store and if any data is shared with other agencies. If people using the system aren’t comfortable with information sharing, they shouldn’t be forced to participate.

    login.gov is working to implement all of these transparency-enhancing features. Further, to help people understand all that is happening, we’re creating a privacy policy that explains how data is shared and what it means to opt out.
  p_3: |-
    Technology and standards for identity verification and authentication can change rapidly. Consumer identity management systems should readily adapt to changing standards and react to new security threats. To make adapting to new policies and capabilities possible, it’s a good practice to build products using agile methods and with changing versions in mind. In other words, plan for modifications to help your identity service be as up-to-date as possible and compliant with current standards and policies.

    We’re embracing this principle for every aspect of the project in building login.gov.

    [Read this guide](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/index.html) to agile principles and practices put together by the 18F team to learn more about what it means to work in an agile way.
  p_4: |-
    Consumer identity management systems store personal information about users so that people don’t have to repeat the verification and authentication processes over and over again. However, collecting and storing personal information raises ethical and legal questions that system designers and developers need to consider. Often, what comes to mind first are technical questions about security: protecting information from unauthorized or illegal access and uses. However, we also need to worry about authorized, legal uses of personal information that violate users’ expectations of privacy. Users of login.gov need to be sure that we’re handling their personal information respectfully and appropriately.

    The first step is only collecting the information you absolutely need. And that’s what login.gov is doing. High-assurance identity verification for sensitive tasks does require extensive information collection. However, many activities don’t require high levels of assurance (LOA) and login.gov supports different LOA so agencies can clearly delineate their users who need lower levels of security from those with more sensitive needs while ensuring usability and data security. Minimizing the amount of information collected and stored not only lowers the security risk; it also reduces worries about re-use and disclosure for users.

    The next step is to give users as much control as possible over what information is shared. We believe firmly that people own their data, not us, and we will always act accordingly. If people aren’t comfortable with the data requirements for using a system, they should know they don’t have to sign up, and that there are other ways to accomplish their goals.

    As we design login.gov, we’re also working to educate users to help them safeguard their own data. We want people to understand why we have to ask for certain kinds of sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and how we’re using them.

    Figuring out who is trying to access personal information and making sure only authorized users can gain access to that information are the keys to consumer identity management. The reason systems like this exist is to secure the user’s identity from those looking to commit theft or fraud.

    Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.

    In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.

    In building login.gov, we’re adhering to standards put forward by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) (NIST 800-63-3). Additionally we’re adhering to [government security best practices](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play11) including FedRAMP, building in the open, conducting rigorous and routine security evaluations in addition to compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

    With one login.gov account, users can securely sign in to multiple government agencies online. login.gov is a FedRAMP approved authentication and identity proofing platform that makes online interactions with the U.S. government simple, efficient and intuitive. login.gov empowers people to feel safe signing into government websites and accessing federal services online with a single, privacy-protected account. We enable agencies managing federal benefits, services, and applications to make their offerings easier and more secure. We save agencies time and money by offering a shared solution for remote identity proofing that is secure and recommended by the [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-288).

    login.gov offers the public a single, secure, and private access to online federal services, eliminating the need to remember passwords for multiple systems.  It also reduces costs of developing or buying duplicative authentication and proofing solutions for agencies, so they can focus on their mission. The more agencies that adopt login.gov, the more taxpayers save. Through login.gov agencies can provide a more consistent customer experience by reducing duplicate accounts and encouraging a 21st Century IDEA compliant experience.
  p_3: |-
    login.gov offers secure two-factor authentication with widely available as well as unphishable methods. This service provides users with secure access to digital services at over 17 different government agencies with a single set of credentials. For you, this means leveraging the best security defined by NIST 800-63 Identity Assurance Level 1 and Authentication Assurance Level 2, and FedRAMP Moderate while complying with 21st Century Idea Act in a easy-to-use experience.

    login.gov identity verification builds on the security of our authentication service and provides a remote proofing experience using an individual’s state-issued ID rather than knowledge-based verification. Our remote proofing implementation complies with NIST’s IAL2. The login.gov verified accounts (IAL2/AAL2) allows applications to access verified attributes about a user such as a phone number and a social security number while maintaining user privacy by requiring the user’s consent and password to decrypt the data.

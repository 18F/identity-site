title: What do I do if an account already exists under my email address?

Confirming access to an email address is the first step in making a login.gov account. If you received a notice that there is already a login.gov account associated with your email address but you don't remember creating it, use your email address to sign in and go through the password reset process.

Please notify login.gov if you are sure you did not create an account, and feel like someone else is using your email address.

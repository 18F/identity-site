To change your password, sign in at login.gov and go to your Profile page. If you want to change your password, select Edit next to password, enter the new password and submit your change. Passwords must be at least 8 characters but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 8 characters.

Instead, try making a long and complex password by using a phrase or a series of words that only you recognize. And please make it different than any other passwords you use to sign into other accounts such as your bank account or email. Using the same passwords for your email, financial and social media accounts makes identity theft easier.

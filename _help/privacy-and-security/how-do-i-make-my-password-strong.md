title: How do I make my password strong?
order: 3

Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.

When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and common misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your company name or your spouse's or children's names - and even your pet - as well as other personal information such as your age or birth date.

If you're already signed in, and you're trying to change your password, email, or phone, you will be prompted to enter your current password before you can make the changes.

But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left unattended. In that case, for your security, we sign you out after three failed attempts.

If you don't know your password, the link to reset it is on the sign-in page. Enter your email address to receive a link to reset your password. Once you follow the link, you'll be asked to enter a new password. Reconfirm that you have your phone (the one you will use to receive one-time passcodes).


After you've successfully signed into login.gov after resetting your password, login.gov will give you a personal key. The personal key is to be used in the event you forget your password or don't have your phone with you. Make a note of it and store it separately from your phone.

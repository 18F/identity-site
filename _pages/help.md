### What is login.gov?

login.gov offers the public secure and private online access to
participating government programs. With one login.gov account, users can
sign in to multiple government agencies. The goal: make managing federal
benefits, services and applications faster and more secure.

The [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov), or GSA, manages
login.gov. As a federal agency, GSA’s mission is to make interactions
with the government easier and more efficient.

Creating an account
-------------------

### How do I create an account with login.gov?

To create a login.gov account, you will need: a valid email address, and
a working phone number. We will also ask you to create a password.

#### Enter your email and confirm it

Select “create an account” and enter your email address where indicated.
Then check your email account for a message from us. Within the email is
a link. Clicking the link will send you back to login.gov with your
email confirmed.

#### Enter your password

Next, you will create a strong password. Use the password strength meter
on the screen as a guide. Passwords must be at least 8 characters, but
otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even enter spaces in
between words to get to 8 characters.

#### Enter your phone number and confirm it

Next, you will enter a phone number at which you can get calls or SMS
messages. If you have a landline, please ask for a security code by a
phone call. We will send a unique security code to that phone number
each time you sign into your account. This is called two-step
authentication. The second step keeps your account more secure than
using only a password.

Each security code expires after 5 minutes and can only be used once. If
you don’t enter the security code within 5 minutes, just request a new
code. Each code is only good once, so no one can steal one you’ve
already used.

Type the security code into the field. That’s it! You have just taken an
important step to keep yourself and your government safe. Every time you
sign back into your login.gov account, you will receive a new security
code that you need to enter. You’ll get the option each time you sign in
to get a security code by a phone call or by SMS.

#### Save your personal key

After you’ve created your account, you will get a personal key, which is
a set of 16 randomly generated letters. Make a note of them and store
the note separately from your phone. If you forget your password or
don't have your phone, you can enter the personal key to access your
services or applications.

### What is two-step authentication?

login.gov uses two-step authentication to keep accounts secure. As its
name implies, two-step authentication (sometimes called two-factor
authentication, or 2FA), requires two different methods to sign into an
account. Usually this means entering a memorized password and a unique
code sent to a device (such as a phone) that you own. Requiring two
methods makes breaking into your account much harder.

### Why do I need to confirm my email address and my phone number?

login.gov uses your email address and phone number to send important
security messages about account activity. We won’t use them for any
other purposes, and we won’t share them with anyone without your express
permission.

### I didn’t receive a confirmation email from login.gov.

If you didn’t receive a confirmation email, check your spam filter.
Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address. If
so, you can always make another account with your correct email address.

-   If you mistyped your address, you can [create a new
    account](https://idp.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email).
-   If you are certain you entered the correct address, choose “Send
    again” to get a new confirmation email.

### Why didn’t I receive a security code to confirm my phone?

If you didn’t receive a security code, check whether you entered your
phone number correctly.

-   If you entered the wrong phone number, you can [update your phone
    number here](https://idp.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email/manage/phone).
-   If you entered your phone number correctly, you can [resend the
    confirmation SMS](#). Select if you want to receive the security
    code by text message if you have a mobile phone or through a phone
    call if you have either a landline or a mobile phone.

### Do I need a mobile phone to use login.gov?

You do not need to own a mobile phone to use login.gov. You do need to
provide a phone number – either a landline or a mobile phone – at which
you can receive security codes every time you sign in either by SMS or
phone call.

### Why do I need to use login.gov to access government services online?

Government agencies decide for themselves how they want to interact with
the public. You were sent to login.gov because the service or program
you want to use has chosen to take advantage of the efficiency and
security of login.gov as a shared technology platform. Once you have
finished at login.gov, you will be directed back to the agency.

We hope login.gov is a convenient and secure option for you. However, if
you prefer not to use login.gov, you can always access government
services. You’ll find more information at your agency.

### What do I do if an account already exists under my email address?

Confirming access to an email address is the first step in making a
login.gov account. If you received a notice that there is already a
login.gov account associated with your email address but you don’t
remember creating it, use your email address to sign in and go through
the password reset process.

If you are not able to sign in or you have other questions about this,
call 1-844-USLOGIN to talk to an information specialist between the
hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except
federal holidays.

Please notify login.gov if you are sure you did not create an account,
and feel like someone else is using your email address.

### What do I do if an account has already been created using my phone number?

If you are not able to sign in or you have other questions about this,
call 1-844-USLOGIN to talk to an information specialist between the
hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except
federal holidays.

Signing in
----------

### What do I need to have in order to sign in?

Every time you log into your account, you will need your email address,
your password, and access to your phone. After you have entered your
email address and password, login.gov will send to your phone a security
code, which you will need to enter into the security code field in order
to be logged in securely.

### What do I do if my password doesn’t work or I forget it?

If you don’t know your password, the link to reset it is on the sign-in
page. Enter your email address to receive a link to reset your password.
Once you follow the link, you’ll be asked to enter a new password.
Reconfirm that you have your phone (the one you will use to receive
one-time passcodes).

After you’ve successfully signed into login.gov after resetting your
password, login.gov will give you a personal key. The personal key is to
be used in the event you forget your password or don't have your phone
with you. Make a note of it and store it separately from your phone.

### What happens if I miss the phone call or the text message with my one-time security code?

Every time you sign in you will need to enter a security code that is
sent to your phone either by text message or by phone call. The security
code you receive expires after 5 minutes and can only be used once. If
you miss entering the security code within the 5 minutes or you just
missed the phone call, just request a new security code. Each security
code is only good once, so no one can steal one you’ve already used. We
limit requests to three every 15 minutes, but otherwise you can request
as many codes as you need.

### If I don’t have my phone with me, can I still sign in?

It is necessary to have your phone in order to get the security key to
sign in. But if you don’t have your phone with you, you will need the
personal key you received when you created your account. Enter the
personal key when instructed and select submit. Once you are signed in,
you will immediately get a new personal key. Please store the personal
key in a safe place separately from your phone since the personal key
will let you sign in to your account in case you don’t have your phone
with you.

We encourage you to store your personal key somewhere other than your
computer or mobile device — this way, you’ll be able to access your
personal key even if your device is stolen or your online accounts are
hacked.

### I can’t remember where my personal key is and I don’t have my phone with me.

If you don’t have your phone or your personal key, you may need to
create a new account and re-verify your personal information. To create
a new account, you will need to use a different email address than you
did when you created your first account. For urgent matters — for
example, to check the status of an in-progress application — you may
want to directly contact the government agency.

Or, if you don’t have your personal key and phone, call 1-844-USLOGIN to
talk to an information specialist between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except federal holidays.

Another option is to log in at a later time when you have your phone
near you.

### Why does the system log me out?

When a user is already signed in, and they want to change their email,
password, or phone number, they must enter their current password first.
After three incorrect guesses, the user is signed out.

The system also logs you out if you entered the security code that was
sent to your phone, incorrectly 3 times. Failed attempts are limited to
three per session, followed by a 5-minute lockout.

### I forgot which email address I used to create an account.

If you can’t remember which email address you used to create your
account, you can use the password reset function to see if your email
address is on file.

Try to sign in as usual and ask to have your password reset. Then, enter
the email address you believe you used to create your account. If we
have your email address in our records, we will send instructions on how
to reset your password. Check your email in a few minutes for these
instructions.

If still can’t remember the email address you used to set up your
account, call 1-844-USLOGIN to talk to an information specialist between
the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday,
except federal holidays.

Changing settings
-----------------

### How do I change my password?

To change your password, sign in at [login.gov](https://idp.login.gov/) and go
to your Profile page. If you want to change your password, select Edit next to
password, enter the new password and submit your change. Passwords must be at
least 8 characters but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even use
more than one word with spaces to get to 8 characters.

Instead, try making a long and complex password by using a phrase or a
series of words that only you recognize. And please make it different
than any other passwords you use to sign into other accounts such as
your bank account or email. Using the same passwords for your email,
financial and social media accounts makes identity theft easier.

### How do I change my email address?

To change your email address, select Edit next to the email address.
Enter the new email address and submit it. Then check your email account
and look for an email from login.gov. Open the email and click on the
link provided. Clicking the link will redirect you back to login.gov.
Once you reach login.gov your new email address is established.

### How do I change the phone number I am using with my account?

To change the phone number where you get your security code, select Edit
next to the phone number and enter the new phone number. login.gov will
immediately send your security code to confirm the new phone number.

Privacy and security
--------------------

### How does login.gov protect my data?

login.gov respects your privacy. We collect personal data online only to
help you fulfill your requests with federal agencies that partner with
us. login.gov manages specific parts of that agency’s website so we
collect personal data in order to provide a secure and private
environment for you to access certain government services. We are bound
by our privacy policy. login.gov does not lease, sell or release your
personal information to private companies, contractors, or vendors for
marketing purposes.

login.gov links to external federal government sites for services
provided by those agencies. Those sites are subject to their own privacy
policy, which is usually spelled out in a privacy policy and legal
disclaimer available on their website.

Individual accounts get a double layer of security. We require
two-factor authentication as well as strong passwords that meet new
[National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/)
requirements for secure validation and verification. This includes
two-step authentication that requires you log in with your password and
a security code you receive on your phone. Two-step authentication can
help protect your account against password compromises.

Your information will stay secure. For more information, read our
[security and privacy policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy). Please email
<[info@login.gov](mailto:info@login.gov)>
to learn more about how our protection works.

### Will login.gov share my information?

login.gov cannot share any information with other government agencies
without the user’s permission. Not even login.gov administrators can
decrypt or access a user’s personal information without the user’s
password.

### How do I make my password strong?

Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple
words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with
many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.

When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and common
misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your company
name or your spouse’s or children’s names - and even your pet - as well
as other personal information such as your age or birth date.

If you’re already signed in, and you’re trying to change your password,
email, or phone, you will be prompted to enter your current password
before you can make the changes.

But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely
due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left
unattended. In that case, for your security, we sign you out after three
failed attempts.

### Can I remove a saved password or login information from my browser?

If you accidentally saved your login.gov password or other sign-in
information in your browser, it’s a good idea for you to delete it; this
will help you keep your account more secure. From the following list,
select the browser (the computer program you use to access the World
Wide Web) you use to learn how to make it erase any saved information:

-   [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606)
-   [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-passwords#w_viewing-and-deleting-passwords)
-   [Internet
    Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17499/windows-internet-explorer-11-remember-passwords-fill-out-web-forms#ie=ie-11)
-   [Safari](https://help.apple.com/safari/mac/8.0/#/ibrw1103)

Also, remember whenever you’re online, check the address bar of any
webpage you’re visiting to make sure that you can trust them, especially
any page that asks you to share a username and password. Be careful
about sharing personal information such as your login credentials,
financial information, or Social Security number over email.

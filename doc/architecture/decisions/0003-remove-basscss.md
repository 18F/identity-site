# 3. Remove BassCSS

Date: 2021-04-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to seamlessly incorporate the US Web Design System (USWDS), we need to remove BassCSS

## Decision

We will remove BassCSS FROM THE `identity-site` repo.

## Consequences

Transitioning from BassCSS to USWDS will allow designers and developers to use a wider range of spacing values in our interfaces. Removing BassCSS will take time and will require close QA to make sure that there are no style regressions.

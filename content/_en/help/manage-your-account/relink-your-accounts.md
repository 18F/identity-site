If you have problems logging into login.gov partner websites after changing your email address, then it is possible the partner linked your account to a different email address. You may want to relink your account to access your information on the partner website. 

Try the following:

1. Login using the previous email address you used to register with the partner agency. 
2. Contact the login.gov partner support and ask them to link your account to the new email address.

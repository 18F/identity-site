    ## One account and password


    Login.gov is a shared service, used by the public, and trusted by government agencies. With one login.gov account, you eliminate the need to remember different passwords for each agency and streamline your sign in process.


    ### Login.gov is trusted by


    * Department of Defense

    * Small Business Administration

    * Trusted Traveler Programs (Department of Homeland Security)

    * USAJOBS (Office of Personnel Management)

    * And more…


    Login.gov is your one account for government. [Learn more about creating an account](https://login.gov/create-an-account/).


    Already have an account? [Sign in to manage your account and update your personal information or security options](https://secure.login.gov/).

    ## Secure and private access for the public


    Login.gov uses [the highest standards of security](https://login.gov/security/) to keep your information safe including identity verification and [two-factor authentication](https://login.gov/help/authentication-methods/which-authentication-method-should-i-use/).


    Login.gov is provided by [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/tts).

    ## **How does it work?**


    Participating agencies use login.gov to help protect their users. When you try to sign in to a participating agency, you’ll be prompted to sign in or create an account with login.gov before you can access your profile with that agency.  


    Here’s how:

    ### All participating agencies use login.gov for secure sign in.


    You provide two pieces of information to securely sign in and protect your information. 


    * Password 

    * Authentication method (such as a one-time code sent to your phone or an authentication app) 


    Using both a password and another method makes it difficult for others to access your information.

    ### Some agencies require you to verify who you are. 


    Login.gov verifies your identity for the agency. By submitting personal identifiable information (PII), such as your photo ID, you can verify that you are you and not someone pretending to be you. We only confirm that you are you and do not make any determination on eligibility for agency services.

        <p>We’re committed to ensuring individuals control their own information in a highly secure manner with a delightful user experience.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to shorten the amount of time it takes to work with the government by reducing paperwork the public has to fill out and forms the government has to process.</p> 
        <p>To do so, we’re making a system that replicates the design, performance, and experience people are used to having when logging into their private email or any top tech industry website.</p>

        <p>A shared authentication platform will reduce the burden of operations, maintenance, and security oversight across the government.</p>
        <p>login.gov handles the software development and customer support of a login system so agencies can focus on providing high-quality services for people to use after they sign in.</p>
        <p>Not only will this free up agency resources to deliver great services, a platform shared among many government agencies reduces costs and improves government efficiency.</p>

        <p>Led by the U.S. Digital Service and 18F, login.gov builds on groundwork laid by the National Institute for Standards in Technology, the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, and the General Services Administration’s Federal Acquisition Service.</p>
        <p>We’re working hand-in-hand with organizations across the government and in the private sector to implement best practices and emerging standards in secure, privacy-protecting authentication.</p>
